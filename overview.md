## Why Do My Recipes Work?

**It Boils Down To 2 Words: Balance and Taste**

Before I explain, I have a question for you: *What are some of your fondest childhood memories?*

One of mine was hearing the ice cream truck coming down the street. I would run to my dad and ask him for a dollar so I could go buy an ice cream bar that had those gumballs that lost their flavor in less than 2 minutes. Another one was going to DiCola’s every time I would visit my grandparents. DiCola’s is a well-known seafood restaurant in Chicago that has the best colossal shrimp, clam strips, and tomato bread I have ever had. Since they had no indoor seating, we would eat our meal in the car or on a piece of wood that was in the parking lot.

Lastly, were the days my dad worked late. Why? He wouldn’t have time to cook so we would go to Bill’s Place, a local restaurant, to pick up dinner. I would either get a gyro, a ham and cheese pita (not-so-coincidentally also in this book), or a slice of pizza.

Some of my greatest memories revolved around food and with over 30 years of these experiences, it would be near impossible to change. For as long as I can remember, my goal has been to develop a diet that I could adhere to indefinitely. After several years of attempting to only eat “clean foods” and completely depriving myself of the foods I always loved, I realized I needed to try and make my favorite foods fit into my day-to-day diet. If I didn’t, I would fail each and every time I dieted.

### How Does This Relate to My Recipes Working?

Since then, my goal has been to make every recipe as close to “Chicago good” as possible, while also striking a balance between lower calories, higher protein, and sufficient volume to feel full and satisfied. If you are from Chicago, you know how spoiled we are with great food from every culture, so “Chicago good” simply means having the most flavor and being as delicious as humanly possible.

The best part about the recipes I create is that most of them are low enough in calories that it allows for going on dinner dates, having a few drinks, or indulging in some Krispy Kreme® donuts without worrying about gaining weight. This is pivotal for anyone and everyone that has a thriving social life, significant other, and/or likes trying new food and restaurants.

In this book you will be able to make pizza, ice cream, famous fast food items, burgers, and more — and all these recipes taste nearly as good as the full calorie version. Because of this, you will never have to sacrifice the foods you love because of your “diet.”

## Pantry Essentials

There are ingredients I like to have in my pantry and then there are ingredients I **NEED** to have in my pantry. Everything listed below is in my pantry or fridge 24/7 and work in unison with one another.

* **Vital Wheat Gluten:** If you are going to be baking any bread or making any pizzas, I would highly recommend having a bag of vital wheat gluten in your pantry. It has the same grams of protein per serving as protein powder, but costs a fraction of the price.
* **Erythritol:** Erythritol is an artificial sweetener or sugar substitute that is used to sweeten recipes without adding additional calories to them. The two brands I use are Swerve® and Purecane®. I would get both a granulated version and brown sugar version.
* **Flour:** Essential. If you are only going to buy one, get all-purpose flour. If you want to splurge, get King Arthur® bread flour as well.
* **Protein Powder:** The protein powder I use is a whey/casein blend (specifically PEScience). Make sure you get a whey/casein blend. If you only have one flavor, make it vanilla.
* **Instant Yeast:** Essential for pizzas, buns, and bread. Keep it in the freezer after opening.
* **Corn Meal:** Used for Deep Dish Pizza and for unloading pizzas from a peel onto a steel.
* **Cocoa Powder:** I recommend Dutch cocoa powder. If making cookies n' cream recipes, get black cocoa powder.
* **Xanthan Gum:** Thickens and emulsifies recipes (crucial for protein ice creams). Guar gum is also recommended for ice creams.
* **Black Pepper:** Always freshly cracked.
* **Red Pepper Flakes:** Adds spice without changing the base taste.
* **Salt:** Essential. I use iodized salt, but kosher works too.
* **Dried Spices:** Essential 5: Red pepper flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and paprika.
* **Aromatics:** Onions, garlic, scallions.
* **Extra-Virgin Olive Oil:** Essential for savory foods.
* **Fresh Herbs:** Parsley and cilantro.
* **Lemon/Lime:** Juice for marinades/sauces, zest for garnish.
* **Tomatoes:** Canned San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes (Cento® brand recommended) and tomato paste.
* **Avocado Oil:** Great source of mono-saturated fat, neutral flavor for baking.
* **Chipotle Peppers:** Canned in adobo sauce. Adds smoky, spicy flavor.
* **Condiments:** No sugar added ketchup, mustard, Sriracha, no sugar added BBQ sauce, light mayonnaise, soy sauce, hot sauce, buffalo sauce.
* **Parmigiano Reggiano:** Worth the money. A few grams goes a long way.
* **Mozzarella:** Fat-free and part-skim blocks (shred it yourself).
* **Eggs:** Essential. Keep liquid egg whites on hand too.
* **Milk:** Fairlife® recommended (double the protein), but regular works.

## Kitchen Gear

* **Pizza Steel:** If you make pizzas or dough, buy one. It browns the bottom of a pizza unlike anything else. I recommend a 16”x16”.
* **Pizza Peel:** Makes life 10x easier to shoot pizzas into the oven. Match the size to your steel.

## Cooking Techniques

### Preparing Chicken Breasts

It took me more than 10 years to make chicken breasts that I can enjoy without any sauces, oils, or seasonings. Just salt and chicken. Don’t make dry and bland chicken like I did for over a decade.

1. **Trim your chicken breasts:** Use kitchen scissors to remove visible tendons and fat. Flip the breast to find the tendon running down the middle and cut it out.
2. **Tenderize your meat:** Place chicken in a gallon bag. Using the flat side of a meat tenderizer, pound gently from the center out until about a half-inch thick.
3. **Salt your chicken:** This retains moisture. I usually dry brine or marinade overnight.

### Brining / Dry Brining Meat

* **Wet Brine:** 5% salt to water ratio (5g salt per 100g water). Submerge meat, refrigerate for 1-12 hours.
* **Dry Brine:** 1.5% salt to meat ratio (1.5g salt per 100g meat). Coat evenly. Refrigerate uncovered for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.

### Roasting Vegetables

* **Slow Roast:** Chop veggies, toss with light oil/seasoning. Bake at 400°F for 20-40 mins, tossing halfway.
* **Broil:** Preheat broiler. Place whole veggies (like peppers) 3-4" from heat. Broil 3-10 mins until charred. Peel skin after cooling.

### Roasted Garlic

1. Chop off the top of a garlic head to expose cloves.
2. Spray with oil, add salt/pepper.
3. Wrap in foil and bake at 400°F for 45 minutes.

### Kneading Dough

1. Lightly dust surface with flour.
2. Press dough down and away with the heel of your hand.
3. Fold in half, press down and away.
4. Repeat until smooth and elastic (5-10 mins).

### Pickling Vegetables

1. Slice vegetables and place in a jar.
2. Boil equal parts water and vinegar with salt (15-30g per 1000g liquid) and spices (garlic, peppercorns, dill).
3. Pour hot liquid over veggies. Let cool, then refrigerate.

### Blooming Spices

1. Add oil to a hot pan (or create a "dugout" in the middle of food).
2. Add spices to the hot oil.
3. Cook for 30-60 seconds until fragrant, then combine with food.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Should I eat every meal exclusively from this cookbook?**
While you certainly can, it’s not necessary. I typically eat 1-2 meals from the book everyday while also rounding out my other meals with simple snacks, fruits, vegetables, and leftovers.

**2. Am I guaranteed to lose weight if I eat from this cookbook?**
No. Regardless of food choices, if you are in a calorie surplus, you will gain weight. You must track your intake.

**3. Are the nutrition facts 100% accurate?**
No, but they are as accurate as possible. Labels round numbers, and ingredients vary.

**4. How do I accurately track recipes that use breading or marinades?**
It is tedious to calculate perfectly (weighing before and after). I recommend adding a buffer of ~100 calories to your daily log to account for variables like marinades and oils.

**5. Do you have any recommended kitchen equipment?**
Yes, see the **Kitchen Gear** section. A Creami® or Ninja® blender is key for ice creams; a pizza steel is key for pizzas.

**6. Does it matter what blender I use for ice creams?**
Yes! I recommend the Ninja® blender. I broke 2 others trying to make protein ice cream.

**7. Do you have any recommended supplements and special ingredients?**
See the **Pantry Essentials** section. Common special ingredients include vital wheat gluten, oat fiber, xanthan gum, etc.

**8. Some of these ingredients are expensive, are they worth it?**
Vital wheat gluten ($20) lasts months and is cheaper than protein powder per serving. Xanthan gum lasts over a year. It is usually worth the investment.

**9. Can I substitute ingredients?**
Yes, but I cannot guarantee results. Coconut flour does *not* sub 1:1 for regular flour.

**10. Is measuring food ACTUALLY important?**
Absolutely 100%. A food scale ($20-30) is worth the investment to ensure recipes turn out correctly and calorie counts are accurate.

**11. Why do some recipes call for extra meat/sauce when the final recipe only needs a small amount?**
Batch cooking saves time. I list enough for multiple meals so you don't have to prep every single day.

**12. What is the difference between cooked meat and raw meat?**
Cooked meat usually weighs 75% of raw meat due to water loss. If a recipe calls for 112g raw, it will weigh about 84g cooked.

**13. What should I do if I want cookie dough but am worried about raw eggs?**
Use pasteurized eggs or carton egg whites.

**14. What if an ingredient is unavailable in my country?**
Email me for potential solutions.

**15. What is erythritol?**
A sugar substitute with very few calories that does not affect blood sugar. It allows for sweetness without the massive calorie load of sugar.

**16. Does erythritol have calories?**
Debatable (0 to 23 cal per 100g). For this book, I treat it as 0, but you can add a buffer calorie count if you prefer.

**17. Why do you use erythritol to sweeten everything?**
It digests best with fewest side effects, is cost-effective, and replaces sugar 1-to-1.

**18. Can I substitute other sweeteners?**
Yes, just try to keep the 1-to-1 ratio.

**19. Why do you mention specific brands?**
Because those are the specific products I used to get the macronutrient counts and flavor profiles listed. Different brands (like tomatoes) can taste vastly different.

**20. Why do some recipes have net carbs added to them?**
Net carbs are the carbs your body actually utilizes. Erythritol is a carb but isn't metabolized, so it is subtracted.

**21. My baked recipe is dry and AWFUL. Why?**
Overcooking by even 1-2 minutes or substituting fats can ruin texture.

**22. Why am I getting different calories when I input the recipe into my app?**
Brands vary significantly. For 100% accuracy, log the specific brands you are using in your kitchen.

**23. Do I have to use fat-free milk in ice creams?**
No. Use whatever milk fits your diet/digestion, but cow's milk offers the most authentic flavor.

**24. What if I need more detail than the instructions have?**
Check the YouTube video for the specific recipe to see visual cues.

**25. Why are some instructions different than your YouTube videos?**
I updated recipes for the book to meet my current cooking standards, which have improved over time.

**26. What if my dough is too dry or too wet?**

* Too dry: Add 5-10g liquid.
* Too wet: Add 5-10g flour.
Humidity, flour brand, and season can all affect dough.
