INTRODUCTION
When a diet of chicken, broccoli, rice, and unsalted almonds
with a side of plain oatmeal was considered the only way
to lose weight, this is exactly what I used to tell myself —
REPEATEDLY. This was before Instagram was created and
YouTube had juuuuuust started becoming popular, but there
were no recipes or quality nutrition information yet. Unless
you were in Greg Doucette’s kitchen every morning, there
was no anabolic diet and “if it fits your macros” was practiced by very few, if anyone at all, and most certainly wasn’t
common knowledge.
I tried many times to eat copious amounts of hard-boiled
eggs and plain chicken to “finally lose the weight and keep
it off.” For some reason, with every attempt, I kept telling
myself that this time would be different. This time I would
be able to do it forever. This time I would be able to push
through. Without fail, 12, or MAYBE 16 weeks later, I would be
sick of the same food, look pretty good in the mirror, and say
“Fuck it”. I’d go right back to my old ways of Chinese takeout multiple nights a week parlayed with my favorite pizza
place and McDonald’s® the other nights of the week. On
the weekend, it was time to go out with the boys and drink
copious amounts of alcohol and end the night with a full
bag from Taco Bell® that I would demolish before I went to
sleep. Funny enough, during some of these fat loss phases,
I was still working out 4 or 5 times a week, but you can’t
outwork alcohol, fast food, and a massive appetite. In just 2
or 3 months, I was right back to where I started, if not even
heavier and worse off.
As YouTube started to become more educational, I would
watch people like Layne Norton and Zach Rocheleau
(TheFlexibleDietingLifestyle). They started to teach me
that you can eat the stuff you like in moderation, but you
can also make it at home using lower calorie ingredients
and eat it ALL. THE. TIME. This was about the same time I
was in college, majoring in exercise physiology and learning
about the laws of thermodynamics and calories in/calories
out. All of this new information coupled with more low-calorie meal options popping up in grocery stores (think protein pancakes) started changing my mindset. At this point,
I slowly started cooking more and learning my way around
the kitchen.

Fast forward a couple of years and Greg Doucette made a
splash onto the scene. Once anabolic french toast was introduced to me, I realized the possibilities really were endless.
My goal moving forward was to make recipes that not only
helped me lose weight, but tasted great — even if I was eating them day in and day out for weeks on end. I started making my protein ice cream recipes and the rest is history.
So, why should you care?
I mean you really shouldn’t.
However, the process of finding meals that are easy to fit
into your schedule, you never get sick of, and get you to (or
close to) your physique goals is going to take time. We haven’t even talked about the amount of calories you need to
be eating, how many times a day you like to eat, and what
parts of the day you should be having bigger meals. Oh, and
let’s not forget about all the different variables that come into
play when trying to combine diet with exercise too.
With all the information we have at our fingertips, you should
be able to figure it out a lot faster than I did, but it is also okay
if it takes you a few years to learn exactly what works for
you and your body. It took me over 10 years of trial and error
to find what works for me. (That’s well over 3,000 days for
anyone counting.) Shit, even to this day I am still finding new
foods and different techniques that are helping me progress.
Hopefully your journey to finding what works for you will be
a lot shorter than mine, but always remember, learning takes
a lot of time and repetition.
My goal with this book is to make all the information as easy
to digest as possible, so you can take the knowledge in the
pages ahead and apply it to your daily life. To this day, I still
make Greg’s anabolic french toast and just that recipe alone
has changed my life in more ways than I could’ve ever imagined. I hope after reading through and testing the recipes in
this book, you find your anabolic french toast and it changes
the way you look at dieting, forever.

DIET CHEAT CODES

WHY DO MY
RECIPES WORK?
IT BOILS DOWN TO 2 WORDS:
B A L A N C E A N D TA S T E
Before I explain, I have a question for you:
What are some of your fondest childhood memories?
One of mine was hearing the ice cream truck coming down
the street. I would run to my dad and ask him for a dollar so I
could go buy an ice cream bar that had those gumballs that
lost their flavor in less than 2 minutes.
Another one was going to DiCola’s every time I would visit
my grandparents. DiCola’s is a well-known seafood restaurant in Chicago that has the best colossal shrimp, clam
strips, and tomato bread I have ever had. Since they had no
indoor seating, we would eat our meal in the car or on a
piece of wood that was in the parking lot.

Since then, my goal has been to make every recipe as close
to “Chicago good” as possible, while also striking a balance
between lower calories, higher protein, and sufficient volume to feel full and satisfied. If you are from Chicago, you
know how spoiled we are with great food from every culture,
so “Chicago good” simply means having the most flavor and
being as delicious as humanly possible.
The best part about the recipes I create is that most of them
are low enough in calories that it allows for going on dinner
dates, having a few drinks, or indulging in some Krispy Kreme®
donuts without worrying about gaining weight. This is pivotal
for anyone and everyone that has a thriving social life, significant other, and/or likes trying new food and restaurants.
However, most of the time, these extras aren’t even necessary.
WHY?

Lastly, were the days my dad worked late. Why? He wouldn’t
have time to cook so we would go to Bill’s Place, a local
restaurant, to pick up dinner. I would either get a gyro, a ham
and cheese pita (not-so-coincidentally also in this book), or
a slice of pizza.

In this book you will be able to make pizza, ice cream, famous
fast food items, burgers, and more — and all these recipes
taste nearly as good as the full calorie version. Because
of this, you will never have to sacrifice the foods you love
because of your “diet.”

B U T H O W D O E S T H I S R E L AT E T O M Y R E C I P E S
WORKING?

Now, my childhood memories live on, and it is impossible to
feel like I am missing out on any of my favorite foods when
I can make them all at home. Not only that, but when I do
want dinner from my favorite pizza place, for example, I can
easily fit it into my diet with all the low-calorie options I could
eat earlier in the day.

Some of my greatest memories revolved around food and
with over 30 years of these experiences, it would be near
impossible to change. For as long as I can remember, my
goal has been to develop a diet that I could adhere to indefinitely. After several years of attempting to only eat “clean
foods” and completely depriving myself of the foods I always
loved, I realized I needed to try and make my favorite foods
fit into my day-to-day diet. If I didn’t, I would fail each and
every time I dieted.

To me, this is the best of both worlds and keeps me at my
best physique of all time with minimal effort.

Why Do My Recipes Work?

DIET CHEAT CODES

PANTRY
ESSENTIALS
There are ingredients I like to have in my pantry and then there are ingredients I
NEED to have in my pantry. Everything listed below is in my pantry or fridge 24/7
and work in unison with one another. For example, if I woke up at 4am and all the
grocery stores were closed, I could still make a pizza from scratch. How? Because
I always have flour, vital wheat gluten, instant yeast, salt, canned tomatoes, and
mozzarella on hand. If you are a fan of making as little grocery trips as possible, I
highly recommend having these items in your house.

V I TA L W H E AT G L U T E N
If you are going to be baking any
bread or making any pizzas, I would
highly recommend having a bag of
vital wheat gluten in your pantry. It has
the same grams of protein per serving
as protein powder, but costs a fraction
of the price. If you buy a bag of vital
wheat gluten, it will last you months
and is worth every penny.

ERYTHRITOL
Erythritol is an artificial sweetener or
sugar substitute that is used to sweeten
recipes without adding additional calories to them. Erythritol was used to test
and create all the recipes that include a
sweetener in this cookbook. In my opinion, erythritol cooks, bakes, and tastes
the best. If you prefer another sweetener, feel free to use it as a substitute.
The two brands of erythritol I have experience with are Swerve® and Purecane®. I
would get both a granulated version and
brown sugar version as both are used
frequently throughout this cookbook.

Pantry Essentials

FLOUR
PROTEIN POWDER
The protein powder I use is a whey/
casein blend and more specifically is
made by PEScience. Whatever brand
you choose, make sure you get a
whey/casein blend. Also, if you are
only going to have one flavor on hand,
make sure it is vanilla. It works with
almost any recipe and can easily be
modified. For example, if you need
chocolate protein powder, you can sub
in some cocoa powder along with a
little bit of extra sweetener.

Flour is essential in any pantry and
that is because it is used in various
recipes. From pizzas, to muffins, to
baguettes, to cookie dough, flour is
necessary. If you are only going to buy
one, get all-purpose flour. If you want
to splurge a little bit, get all-purpose
flour, but also add King Arthur® bread
flour to the arsenal. For the quality,
how long it will last in your pantry, and
how many recipes you will be able to
make with one four-pound bag, it is
well worth it.

DIET CHEAT CODES

I N S TA N T Y E A S T
I make pizzas, buns, and bread
multiple times per week. To make any
of them, I need yeast. I buy the 4oz
bottle and keep it in the freezer after I
open it. This will keep it fresh and lasts
many months before going bad.

CORN MEAL
Corn meal is a more niche pantry
product, but I always have it stocked.
It is used in my DEEP DISH PIZZA ,
but is also very useful to help load and
unload pizzas from a pizza peel onto a
pizza steel. I also like the texture and
taste it gives to the finished pizza as
well. And who knows, maybe one day I
will make cornbread. :)

COCOA POWDER
Again, cocoa powder is more of a
niche product, but is something
I always have on hand. If I had to
choose one cocoa powder to have,
it would be the dutch version. King
Arthur® also makes a great double
dark cocoa powder that I highly
recommend. If you are going to make
any of my cookies n’ cream recipes,
I would suggest having black cocoa
powder on hand as well.

XANTHAN GUM
Xanthan gum thickens and emulsifies
recipes, so the protein ice creams
come out as smooth as soft serve and
the condiments keep their consistency after refrigerating. Guar gum
is another ingredient I would recommend if you are going to be making
protein ice creams regularly as it gives
the cream an even better consistency
when combined with xanthan gum.
Xanthan gum may seem pricey, but
you only need a gram or two at a time,
meaning you can make 200-400 recipes with just one pound.

BLACK PEPPER
Always, always, ALWAYS freshly
crack your pepper, if possible. I buy
whole peppercorns and I use either
an electric pepper mill or a mortar
and pestle to crush them down right
before cooking.

RED PEPPER FLAKES
There are a ton of ways you can add
spice to a dish, but red pepper flakes
are what I grew up on. I would also
argue it doesn’t change the taste of
any recipe and can easily be added as
a topping to many dishes like pasta
or even a slice of pizza. Red pepper
flakes will be in my pantry for life.

S A LT
A recipe can be cooked to perfection,
but if it isn’t salted correctly your taste
buds will tell you it sucks. Every pantry
needs to have salt and, in my case, I
use iodized salt. It dissolves quickly,
costs 60 cents for a pound and a half,
and I honestly can’t tell a difference
when I use different types of salt on
the same dish. Kosher salt is the most
widely used type of salt and since
this book almost always measures in
grams you can use any salt you want.
If you make one of my dishes and it
is too salty, I would use less salt than
I include in my ingredient list going
forward. Salt preferences are different
for everyone, but you can always add
more salt if you need to. However,
once you’ve salted a dish, you can’t
take it away.

DRIED SPICES
There are no hard rules on how many
spices you should have. Some people
may only need 5 spices and use them
for everything. Personally, I have a
spice rack with about 40 different
spices. If you are going to use a
specific spice, even semi-regularly, I
would have it on hand. If I were forced
to pick 5 spices and throw the rest
away, I would pick red pepper flakes,
garlic powder, onion powder, oregano,
and paprika.

A R O M AT I C S
Aromatics help add a ton of flavor to
your food with little effort. There are
a ton of different aromatics, but the
ones I always have ready to go are
onions, garlic, and scallions. Desserts
aside, you will notice many of the
recipes include at least one of these,
if not more.

E X T R A-V I R G I N O L I V E O I L
If you are going to buy one oil for
savory foods, it would be extra-virgin
olive oil. And the only ingredient on
the bottles ingredients list should be
extra-virigin olive oil. This doesn’t have
to be expensive either. At Sam’s Club® 3
liters of EV olive oil costs less than $20
and should last you more than a year,
even if you are cooking every day.

FRESH HERBS
Fresh herbs add flavor and freshness
that dried spices just can’t replicate.
The two I have on hand at all times
are parsley and cilantro. They are both
used in combination in many recipes
throughout the book and work as a
garnish on most recipes.

LEMON
Having 1 or 2 lemons and/or limes in
the fridge at all times is a great idea.
The juice can be added to marinades,
sauces, and as a garnish for several
dishes. Not only can you use the juice
of a lemon, but you can use the outer
lemon for zest that is also a perfect
garnish for both sweet and savory
dishes. Not to mention, lemon water is
delicious.

Pantry Essentials

T O M AT O E S
Having fresh tomatoes in your fridge
is always a good idea, but in this
instance I am referring to canned
tomatoes. At any given time, I have
4-8 cans of San Marzano whole
peeled tomatoes and crushed
tomatoes in my pantry. A few cans of
tomato paste are sitting right next to
the San Marzanos because the two
usually go hand in hand. And I use all
Cento® everything. In my opinion, it is
the superior tomato brand.

AV O C A D O O I L
Avocado oil is a great source of monosaturated fat, and has a neutral flavor
for recipes that call for it. For example,
in a baked good like my PUMPKIN
MUFFINS , I am reaching for the avocado oil every time.

CHIPOTLE PEPPERS
I love having chipotle peppers in
adobo sauce in my pantry because
they last forever and are a great addition to any dish to bring a punch of
smoky, spicy flavor that very few ingredients can provide. If you want less
spice, just use the adobo sauce they
are packed in instead of the pepper.
If you haven’t made my CHIPOTLE
AIOLI SAUCE , stop what you are
doing right now and go make it.

CONDIMENTS
If I listed all of the condiments in my
fridge separately, it would’ve made this
list twice as long, I am a condiment
whore and always keep a bunch of
low-calorie options on hand. Let’s do
a speed run of the staples: no sugar
added ketchup, mustard, Sriracha, no
sugar added BBQ sauce, light mayonnaise, soy sauce, hot sauce, and
buffalo sauce.

MILK
Similar to eggs, milk can be utilized
in countless ways and is included in a
majority of recipes in this cookbook.
Fairlife® is the brand I utilize for all of
my recipes, because it tastes delicious and has double the protein per
serving. If you are ballin’ on a budget,
regular milk will work with all of these
recipes as well!

CHEESE
PA R M I G I A N O R E G G I A N O
Considered one of the finest cheeses
in all of the land, Parmigiano Reggiano
is typically aged for 24 months and
is only produced in Italy. Although
expensive, it is worth every dollar and
a few grams goes a long way. I love
the green bottle parm as much as the
next person, but if you can afford it,
parm reg should have a permanent
place in your fridge.

All cheeses are great, unless your
name is swiss, but when I don’t have
mozzarella in the fridge, I feel naked.
Mozzarella can easily be bought in
8oz or 16oz packages that stay fresh
in the fridge for months before going
bad. When you need it, shred it, and
add it to whatever recipe calls for it.
I always keep both fat-free and partskim on hand.

EGGS
Not much needs to be said about
eggs. They strictly provide benefits
with no downside. Need an easy to
make protein source for breakfast?
Eggs. Don’t have enough calories
for the yolk? Only use the egg white.
Want to make cookie dough, meatballs, or french toast? Eggs. I always
have an 18 pack in my fridge and you
should too.

KITCHEN
GEAR
CUTTING BOARD
Have you ever rushed to the kitchen to attempt a new recipe, only to find out that
you’re lacking the required equipment to finish the job? I’ve experienced this exact
scenario many times, and it’s the WORST. Having the right tools for the job will
not only allow you to create the recipe, but will also make your life in the kitchen
inexplicably easier. This equates to food on the table more quickly while also being
more delicious. I regularly utilize the tools mentioned on this list, and many of them
are featured in numerous recipes throughout this book. While a few items on the
list are only necessary in specific circumstances, after reading the details about
each item, you should be able to decide whether or not you’d like to add them to
your assortment of kitchen gear.

SCALE
If you don’t have a scale, you won’t be
able to make the recipes in this book,
so that is why it is numero uno on this
list. A scale only costs between $20$30 and if you buy a good one it will
last you many years. Just make sure
you buy one that weighs to .01 grams,
so ingredients will get picked up by
the scale, even if it is less than a gram.

20

Kitchen Gear

The chef’s knife goes hand in hand
with the cutting board. I personally
like having a set of cutting boards that
includes a small, medium, and large
board to use in different scenarios.
However, if I had to pick one, I would
get a large cutting board. By large I
mean at least 18” wide and 12” long. If
you have the space, a 24”x18” board is
even better. This is because you can
get all your prep work done without
having to find other plates or accessories to put the chopped ingredients on.
Ideally, you can cut all your vegetables
on the same cutting board before
transferring them to a sperate bowl or
preheated pan. Also, you won’t need to
wash it multiple times during a recipe.

CHEF’S KNIFE
Chopping, dicing, and slicing is a
regular step in many of the recipes
contained in this book and a chef’s
knife is an essential tool to have in the
kitchen. While a knife block with an
assortment of knives is extremely convenient, you only need one 8-9” chef’s
knife to get the job done 95% of the
time. I use a knife that costs around
$30, and it has completed its job for
over a year. Every once in a while, you
will need to sharpen it, but that is no
different than any knife, even ones that
cost hundreds of dollars.

SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE
POTS
This is one of the areas I would
recommend all sizes. Large pots are
necessary to make pasta or COOKED
MARINARA while small pots are great
for, well, small parts of a recipe. A
couple examples include making garlic
butter or a nacho cheese sauce.

DIET CHEAT CODES

L A R G E N O N S T I C K PA N
I love my cast iron and it is next on the
list, but a nonstick pan is my go-to for
many recipes because it really makes
the cooking AND cleaning experience
so much easier. Eggs are a breeze,
grilled cheeses brown to perfection,
stir frys come together in minutes, and
pancakes comes out perfect every
time. I would get one that is 12” and
have that be your daily driver.

12” CAST IRON
Cast iron pans will literally last you
generations and can cook certain
recipes better than any pan I have
used before. Steaks get a perfect sear,
smashburgers get scraped off to keep
all the tasty char on the burger, and
deep dish pizzas get a crispy crust
while being perfectly melty in the
middle. There is a little bit of a learning
curve to clean and maintain a cast
iron, but once you get it down, it is an
essential item for any home cook.

S H E E T PA N
Sheet pans have become one of my
favorite pieces of kitchen gear. You
can make a weeks worth of roasted
vegetables in one go OR you can
make a family sized pizza with minimal
effort. They will last forever and are an
essential part of my cooking.

EXTRA SMALL BOWLS

M E TA L T O N G S

Extra small bowls are great for a faster
prep or for dipping sauces. I like to
have my ingredients chopped and
separated into these bowls before I
start cooking, especially for recipes
that cook quickly.

A good pair of tongs last forever. I still
have the ones my dad gave me that
have been in use for 30+ years. I love
a spatula, but when you need more
control, tongs come in clutch.

SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE
BOWLS

MEDIUM WHISK

Some of the recipes inside this book
won’t need any bowls while some will
require all three sizes. It is good to
have 2 or 3 bowls of each size just in
case you need multiple of the same
size in one recipe.

MEASURING CUP
Typically, I don’t use measuring cups.
However, when it comes to adding
water to dough, I like controlling the
pour and I can’t get that with regular
cups. Plus, I can gauge how many
grams of water are in the cup as I am
filling it up at the sink. The one I use is
made of glass and measures 2 cups.

Whisking is something I do daily.
Having a small and large whisk is nice,
but if I only had a medium whisk, I
would still be able to complete all the
steps necessary to make any recipe in
this book, so invest in a good one.

WOODEN SPOON
Wooden spoons come in handy when
you are cooking something that likes
to stick to the bottom of a pot and you
want to avoid scratching its surface.
What comes to mind instantly is pasta.
It also won’t melt like some other
kitchen utensils might. Get one and
get to cooking.

MESH STRAINER
S I L I C O N E S P AT U L A S
I never knew how much I loved
silicone spoons until I started my
YouTube channel. Scraping the sides
of a bowl or pan mid recipe was a
nightmare before I invested in some
and I wish I knew about them sooner.
They also protect your nonstick and
are great for recipes that call for folding in ingredients.

B O X G R AT E R
Ice cream recipes make up the majority of this cookbook, but the most
used ingredient has to be cheese. I
find myself grating blocks of cheese at
least once per week and a box grater
gets the job done time and time again.

While I don’t use a mesh strainer very
often, I always have one on hand. They
can sift dry ingredients, strain liquids,
and remove seeds and pulp. They are
also great for finishing a dessert with a
dusting of powdered sugar.

CAN OPENER
GARLIC PRESS

M E AT T E N D E R I Z E R
A meat tenderizer breaks down the
muscle fibers and connective tissue of
a piece of meat making for a more tender and flavorful dish. I use it at least
once a week and it is worth purchasing if you prep meat regularly.

I am a hoe for garlic. I will add garlic
to almost anything and if it is my dish
I add extra garlic. My garlic press gets
used and abused and I recommend
getting one for yourself. It is light years
easier and faster than mincing garlic
with a knife and it is used in most
recipes.

I suspect you already have a can
opener, but without one my canned
tomatoes would never turn into pasta
sauce. Make sure you always have one
on hand.

V E G E TA B L E P E E L E R
FOOD THERMOMETER
R A S P G R AT E R
Also known as a Microplane®, I mainly
use this to zest lemons/limes and
grate Parmigiano Reggiano. There
isn’t another kitchen tool like it, and it
comes in handy on a regular basis.

22

Kitchen Gear

Food thermometers are clutch when
making any meat. I always want to
make sure my chicken breasts don’t
become dry and overcooked and that
my steak is perfectly medium rare.
Overcooking can happen in just 5-10
degrees or what can be as little as
30-60 seconds.

I don’t need a vegetable peeler all the
time, but if I want to make recipes like
my FRENCH FRIES or my SLOPPY
JOES I need one ready to go. Luckily,
they are small and don’t take up much
space in any drawer.

DIET CHEAT CODES

CITRUS SQUEEZER
A rasp grater will get the zest off a
lemon and the citrus squeezer will get
the juice out of a lemon. If you have to
squeeze more than half a lemon at a
time, I highly recommend one of these.
They get ALL the juice out and catch
most of the seeds so you don’t have to
pick them out of the bowl.

KITCHEN TOWELS
I wash and dry my hands, what feels
like a million times per day. Kitchen
towels are also great for cleaning up
the work surface and counters while
you are cooking or to quickly wipe
your hands off. I like to have 6-8 towels
in my kitchen because I go through
them quite frequently and don’t want
to wash the same two towels every
other day.

Why would you need masking tape,
you ask? I use it to date all my deli
containers. I was notorious for
throwing something in my fridge then
completely forgetting when I threw it
in there in the first place, so I had no
idea whether it was old or not. I simply
put a piece of masking tape on the
top of a deli container, label it with the
date, put the top on, and throw it in
the fridge. When I am done with the
food, I take the tape off, and wash the
container. Those little pieces of tape
have helped me immensely.

BASTING BRUSH
A basting brush comes in handy when
trying to add egg wash to a bun or to
cover a freshly made pizza crust with
garlic butter. This is another small
kitchen tool that is worth having on
hand.

S P R AY B O T T L E
I use a spray bottle to clean off
surfaces all day long. Fill it with a concentrated cleaning solution and water
for a cheap disinfectant that will keep
things looking spotless.

DOUGH SCRAPER
If you won’t be making any doughs,
pizzas, or breads you may not need
this. However, I make these recipes all
the time, so this tool comes in clutch
on many occasions.

ROLLING PIN
If you don’t make pitas, tortillas, or
pizzas, you won’t need this, but it is a
good tool to have if you do.

SALAD SPINNER
D E L I C O N TA I N E R S
Coming in 3 different sizes, these deli
containers have been a lifesaver. Since
they are stackable, they save room
both in a cabinet and when storing
food in the fridge. They have a very
tight seal and are my go-to whenever I
have recipes, leftovers, or sauces that
need to be put away.

I just got a salad spinner and it has
changed my vegetable game. It does
take up some storage space, but I can
successfully clean and dry a pound
of lettuce in just a couple of minutes.
It has helped in special cases as well,
like drying off the potatoes for my
FRENCH FRIES in just one spin.

If you ever break down meat for tacos,
sloppy joes, or make guacamole, I
would highly recommend this kitchen
gadget. It won’t scratch up the surface
of your nonstick pan and is very simple to use.

If you plan on making bread, it’s a
necessity. If you don’t want to make
protein bread, skip this one.

S E R R AT E D K N I F E
I like having a large serrated knife for
PROTEIN BREAD and a small serrated
knife for PROTEIN BUNS . If you don’t
plan to make any dough-based recipes, you can pass on getting one.

IMMERSION BLENDER
I use an immersion blender all the time
because it is efficient and effective. If
I need to break down canned tomatoes, I can put the blender right into
the can and the tomatoes are broken
down in seconds. If I quickly need to
add a xanthan gum/oil mixture into a
recipe, to prevent clumping, I use the
immersion blender. And don’t quote
me, but I hope to figure out how to
make low calorie mayonnaise at home
and an immersion blender is a must.
A whisk or your hands can substitute
for an immersion blender, but if you
want ultimate efficiency, I would pick
one up.

AIRFRYER
While I don’t have a ton of recipes that
use an airfryer, I think they should be a
kitchen staple regardless. Why? They
bring leftovers back to life, they cook
food faster than a traditional oven can,
and they can cook a side dish while
the main dish is cooking in the oven.
There are MANY more benefits to
airfryers, but these are the top 3 I can
think of.

NINJA CREAMI®
If you currently buy low calorie ice
cream or you want to make low calorie
ice cream, I HIGHLY recommend a
CREAMi®. Making a pint at home costs
about $1 and many low-calorie pints
in the grocery store cost $5 or more.
This will pay for itself in no time and is
probably one of the greatest inventions for the home kitchen. (sorry air
fryer, you are an extremely close second though) The majority of future ice
cream recipes will also be made with
this appliance, so it is a must have if
you want to be eating new ice cream
recipes for the foreseeable future.

FROTHER
This is an appliance strictly used for
my ice cream recipes, so you may not
need this if you don’t plan on getting a
CREAMi®.

NINJA® BLENDER
The Ninja® Blender I have is technically
a 3-1 that includes a blender, food processor, and a single serving bottle. The
blender is used for my old ice cream
recipes while my food processor is frequently utilized throughout the book.

PIZZA STEEL
If you are going to make pizzas or any
recipes that include dough, I would
buy one in an instant. It browns the
bottom of a pizza unlike any other
piece of equipment and reheats frozen
dough recipes in minutes. It is easy
to clean and maintain and sits in my
oven at all times. I use it many times
per week, and I’m just upset I didn’t
start using it sooner. I would buy one
that is 16”x16” so you have room to
work with when placing a pizza onto
the steel and also have the option
of baking an extra-large pizza if you
would like.

PIZZA PEEL
This makes life 10x easier if you are
making pizza. Shoot pizzas into the
oven with ease, quickly grab them
once they are done, and hang the peel
up when you are finished cooking.
If you are going to invest the money
for a pizza steel, I would invest in a
pizza peel as well. They will last you a
lifetime. Make sure you buy one that
matches your steel. If you buy one that
fits 16” pizzas, but only buy a 14” steel,
you are paying more for no reason.

F O R M A X I M U M F L AV O R

There are a million in-depth, scientific explanations for good
cooking techniques out there. However, from the beginning,
my goal in creating this cookbook was to explain everything
in the simplest terms possible. Any actual chefs or experienced home cooks will probably scoff at my explanations,
but as long as they make sense to you and you can apply
them in the kitchen, I am a happy Exercise4CheatMeals.
These are beginner techniques and can become way more
advanced if you want them to be. If a particular technique
piques your interest, I highly suggest reading more articles
or even buying a book to really take your knowledge to the
next level. I recently purchased The Food Lab by J. Kenji
López-Alt and I learned more in the first 30 pages than I have
watching countless videos on YouTube.

Cooking Techniques

I am no different than you and am learning new things in
the kitchen every single day. That being said, as I learn new
techniques and/or improve techniques already in this section, I will make updates. That way, as I learn, you can too.

2. Tenderize your meat.

Tenderizing your meat essentially just means beating your
meat. It only takes a few seconds and ensures even cooking
and tender meat.
a. Place a chicken breast into a gallon bag.
b. Using the flat side of a meat tenderizer, pound the
chicken gently, starting from the center of the meat and
working your way out.

P R E PA R I N G C H I C K E N B R E AS T S

c. Once the entire breast is about a half inch thick, it is
finished.

It took me more than 10 years to make chicken breasts that I
can enjoy without any sauces, oils, or seasonings.

d. Repeat for any remaining chicken breasts.

Just salt and chicken.
Don’t make dry and bland chicken like I did for over a
decade. Simply apply the following steps before cooking
your chicken.
Trim your chicken breasts, ideally using kitchen
scissors.
Everyone has had an experience where they bite into a
chicken sandwich and it is rubbery, gross, and ruins the rest
of the meal. This is typically caused by tendons, and we can
remove them quickly and easily along with any excess fat.
1.

a. Place the chicken breast on a cutting board with the
smooth side facing up.
b. Using scissors, remove any visible tendons and fat from
the chicken breast.

3. Salt your chicken.

Salt can come in many forms, but this step is crucial to retain
as much moisture in your chicken breasts as possible. Nine
times out of 10, I either dry brine my chicken or throw it in a
bag, add a marinade, and let it sit overnight. Then, I cook it
the next day. If you have never brined chicken before, check
the next cooking technique!

c. Flip the breast over and find the tendon. It usually runs
down the middle of the breast and ends in the thick part
of the breast towards the corner.
d. Cut the corner of the chicken breast to remove the
tendon and any fat that may not have been removed
from the chicken before it was packaged.

B R I N I N G / D R Y B R I N I N G M E AT
WHAT: Salt is added directly on the meat itself or it is dissolved
in water and the meat is added to the saltwater solution.
WHY: A brined piece of meat can hold more moisture than

the same cut of meat that wasn’t brined. The ability to retain
more moisture will make for a juicier final product. In my
experience, this is the case even when the meat is slightly
overcooked. Brining is especially important in lean cuts of
meat such as chicken breast and porkchops because these
cuts are far more prone to overcooking, which leads to a dry,
chewy, and lifeless dinner.
HOW: For a wet brine, I like to use a 5% salt to water ratio.
This simply means I will add 5 grams of salt for every 100
grams of water.

1.

When ready to brine, add enough water to fully submerge
the meat in your container, add salt, whisk until salt is
dissolved, and add your meat.

2. Cover with a lid or plastic wrap, refrigerate, and let the
meat brine for at least an hour, as long as 12 hours.
a. Everyone’s palate is different, so I suggest testing different
lengths of brine time to get the perfect saltiness for
you. However, I would be careful as wet brines are very
powerful and if you leave a chicken breast overnight it may
become too salty for your liking. I would start by brining for
an hour and increase the brine time each time you cook
until it becomes too salty. You will then know your brine
time limit for the rest of eternity (or at least until your taste
buds change). Larger or thicker cuts of meat, such as a
pork tenderloin or a whole turkey, will take longer and will
again be something you have to test for yourself.

28

Cooking Techniques

For a dry brine, I like to use a 1.5% salt to meat ratio. This
simply means I will add 1.5 grams of salt for every 100 grams
of meat. If you would like to make it even simpler, you can
use 1 gram of salt for every 100 grams of meat. The most
important part of a dry brine is to make sure every square
inch of meat is covered. For example, when I dry brine a
chicken breast, I will completely and evenly coat both the
top and bottom with salt. I highly suggest you weigh out your
salt before adding it to your meat. Oversalting is easy to do
if you are pouring straight from the container. Refrigerate the
meat uncovered for at least 1 hour or up to overnight and
you are ready to cook. If you are worried about uncovered
raw meat in your fridge, you can loosely cover the meat with
aluminum foil, making sure it still has room to breathe. In my
experience, dry brining is more forgiving than a wet brine in
that it takes longer for the meat to become overly salty.
THE MORE YOU KNOW: You can also add sugar to your
brine, but I have never done so. If you end up using sugar,
please send me an e-mail or DM on Instagram and let me
know which cut of meat you used and if you think it’s worth
adding.

BROIL
1.

Preheat broiler on high.

2. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil and place the
vegetables, whole, on the pan.
3. Place the pan in the oven with the top of the vegetables
about 3-4” from the broiler. Some ovens have the broiler
below the oven, but for most ovens this means placing the
sheet pan on the top rack of the oven.

or under a broiler.

WHY: Some people think vegetables are gross. I used to be

4. Broil the vegetables for 3-10 minutes, or until the skin is
charred and blistered on all sides.
5. Using tongs, occasionally turn vegetables to ensure even

6. Remove from oven and let cool for 15 minutes.
• Some people will tell you to put the vegetables in a
bowl and cover with a lid to steam them. This method

• Make sure you don’t soak them in oil unless you need

*Vegetables that I commonly like to broil are red peppers,
poblano peppers, and green peppers. This is another good
place to experiment with other vegetables and see what
you like!

3. Place vegetables on a sheet pan lined with parchment
paper and arrange in a single layer.
4. Bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 20-40 minutes,

of cooking times, especially with the added variable
of different ovens. This is where you will have to
experiment and see what works for your palate.

ROASTED GARLIC

KNEADING DOUGH
WHAT: Rolling a formed dough back and forth on a work

WHAT: Putting a head of garlic into an oven.

surface.

WHY: I always keep roasted garlic in my fridge because it
is an easy addition to a main dish, side dish, or sauce as an
instant flavor boost with minimal effort. Since I use roasted
garlic in various dishes throughout the cookbook, I thought
roasted garlic deserved its own section.

WHY: When the dough is kneaded properly, it develops gluten, improves texture, and increases elasticity aka makes it
easier to shape before cooking.

HOW: Get a knife, aluminum foil, and salt.

1.

Take a full head of garlic and chop off the top so that the
tips of the cloves are exposed.

HOW: Kneading gets a bad rap, but is actually extremely simple. I recommend doing it while listening to music, watching
a tv show, or watching your favorite YouTuber.

1.

Lightly dust your work surface with flour and place your
dough on it.

2. Lightly spray top with oil, add a pinch of salt, and a dash
of pepper.

2. Press dough down and away from you using the heel of
your hand.

3. Wrap the garlic head in aluminum foil and bake in a
preheated 400°F oven for 45 minutes.

3. Fold the dough in half and press it down, pushing it away
from you as you do so to elongate it just enough to fold
it again.

TIP: I highly recommend making at least a few heads of garlic at once. Once you see how simple it is to do and how it
adds great flavor to almost any dish, you will find yourself
going through multiple heads per week.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the dough becomes smooth
and elastic. This usually takes 5-10 minutes.
5. Shape the dough into a ball and place it into an oiled bowl
or container and cover for 1-2 hours or according to the
recipe’s instructions.
*I purposely formulated most of my recipes so kneading wasn’t
required. However, if you feel your dough is too wet, shaggy, or
stiff, it wouldn’t hurt to knead it for 5-10 minutes before putting
it in a bowl to rise.

P I C K L I N G V E G E TA B L E S
WHAT: A salt solution used to preserve vegetables while

enhancing their flavor.

WHY: To be frank, they are delicious. Bread + butter pickles anyone? In all seriousness, pickled vegetables massively extend the shelf life of the vegetable while improving
their flavor. They are also extremely convenient while being
insanely versatile. Grab them out of the fridge and add them
to a sandwich, salad, or eat them straight out of the jar.
HOW:

1.

Slice vegetables into desired size and shape. Place them
in a glass jar or plastic container.

2. Boil even parts water and vinegar along with salt and any
spices you want to add for additional flavor.
• Common spices added are garlic cloves, black
peppercorns, and dill.
3. The amount of salt added will vary depending on what
vegetables you are using and personal taste preferences,
but a good rule of thumb is to add 15-30 grams of salt per
every 1000 grams of vinegar solution.
4. Once the vinegar solution comes to a boil, remove from
heat, let it cool for 5-10 minutes, and pour over the sliced
vegetables.
5. Cover with a lid and allow it to come to room temperature.

BLOOMING SPICES
WHAT: Adding ground spices to a hot pan with a thin layer

of oil.

WHY: How long ago were your spices dried and ground?
The first time someone asked me this question it opened my
eyes, wide. Some of the seasonings in your pantry could be
months, if not years old, even if you recently bought them.
When cooking, blooming spices will help release their natural oils and aromas while simultaneously creating a smoother
texture in a dish. Simply put, blooming your spices will
enhance the flavor of any dish with nearly zero extra effort.
HOW:

1.

Add spices to a small bowl and mix to combine.

2. If your preheated pan is empty, add a few grams of oil
to the middle of the pan. If the pan has food in it already,
create a “dugout” in the middle of the pan and then add
oil. Let the oil heat up for 20-30 seconds and then add the
seasonings.
3. Mix the seasonings with the oil and let them cook for 3060 seconds or until they become fragrant.
a. If the pan is very hot, continuously stir the oil/spice
combination to prevent burning.
4. Combine the rest of the food with the seasonings and
continue following the recipe’s instructions.

6. Store in the fridge and allow those flavors to develop. The
longer you let it sit, the stronger the flavor will be. Most of
these vegetables should stay good in the fridge for up to
6 months.

FIBER PER 100G FRUITS
A N D V E G E TA B L E S
Knowing how many calories are in fruits and vegetables is
great, but knowing how much fiber is in them can be a game
changer. I can write a whole book about fiber, but let’s keep
it simple. The FDA recommends we eat at least 25 GRAMS
OF FIBER PER DAY . Consuming enough fiber every day
helps regulate blood sugar, LOWER CHOLESTEROL, LOWER
BLOOD PRESSURE , and keeps you full. AKA it has so many
benefits there is really no reason not to consume it.

Fiber forms a gel-like substance slowing the digestion of
your food through your intestines and makes you feel full
faster and longer. While having a sufficient amount of fiber
every day is recommended, this can be difficult if you don’t
know where to get your fiber from. This is further reiterated
by the data showing that 95% of people don’t meet DAILY
FIBER RECOMMENDATIONS. In the charts below, I have listed
14 different fruits and vegetables that have varying fiber per
100g. If you would like to see the fiber amounts in every fruit

ASKED
QUESTIONS
Should I eat every meal exclusively from this
cookbook?
While you certainly can eat every meal out of this cookbook,
it’s not necessary. I typically eat 1-2 meals from the book
everyday while also rounding out my other meals with simple snacks, a variety of fruits and vegetables, and leftovers.
1.

2. Am I guaranteed to lose weight if I eat from this

No.

cookbook?

Your calorie intake can exceed the calories you burn everyday even if you were strictly eating fruits and vegetables.
Regardless of the food choices, if you’re in a calorie surplus,
you will gain weight. It is important that you track your calorie intake, figure out if what you are eating is bringing you
closer to your goals, and adjust from there.
3. Are the nutrition facts 100% accurate?

No, but they are as accurate as I could get with the information at hand.
While I am as consistent as possible in tracking each and
every item of food I put into this cookbook, it will inevitably
have errors.
Some common places where discrepancies can occur are
the food label itself, the actual weight of the food vs what the
listed weight says on the label, different dietary fibers, and
the quality of the nutrition label testing.
For example, labels always round the calories down, so what
might be 108 calories is actually labeled as 100 calories. If there
are 5 servings in a recipe that is a discrepancy of 40 calories.
The good news is that companies and labels have been doing
this for decades and people still have success losing weight.
If you aren’t losing weight and are consistently eating similar
things, all you need to do is lower your calorie intake and you
will start losing weight as long as you are in a calorie deficit.

Frequently Asked Questions

(PLEASE READ)

4. How do I accurately track recipes that use

breading or marinades?
The only way to legitimately track the breading is to weigh
out the dry and wet ingredients before and after breading and then divide the leftover into all of the ingredient
amounts. Then you must subtract from the total amount of
each ingredient and log it. Sound confusing? That’s because
it is. This is a tedious process and when I perform tests for
any recipes that utilize breading these are the steps I follow. I
then take the average of all my test recipes and log it into my
calorie tracking app. Save yourself the time and effort and let
me do all that work for you.
As far as marinades go, it is impossible. The videos I have
watched pertaining to this subject show that the marinade
will penetrate the surface of the meat, but I will never truly
know how much of that stays in the meat or gets cooked off.
This brings me back to the last answer, where just adding
100 calories at the end of the day to my daily calorie log is the
way to go. This should make up for anything that was near
impossible to calculate accurately.
5. Do you have any recommended kitchen

equipment?
I made an ENTIRELY SEPARATE PAGE for the equipment
I think is necessary when owning this cookbook and why. I
also made a PANTRY LIST of things I commonly keep in my
kitchen and why, which you should check out as well.
Also, I made an Amazon store page that has the supplies I
use in many of my recipes.
You most certainly do not need all these items and can use
minimal equipment for a majority of these recipes.
For example, if you plan to make ice cream, you need to have
a CREAMi® and/or Ninja® blender to make them. However,
if you won’t be making any ice creams, but want to make
pizzas, then I highly recommend a pizza steel and pizza peel.

DIET CHEAT CODES

You can make pizzas without these tools, but it makes the
process of making and cooking them exponentially easier.
Plus, if you buy these kitchen tools once, you have them for
a lifetime.
6. Does it matter what blender I use for ice creams?

Yes, absolutely! I broke 2 blenders trying to make protein
ice cream before I got my Ninja®. In my experience, and from
everyone’s feedback, this is the only blender I would recommend for long-term use. You don’t need the expensive
one either! The first one I bought was their entry level, $70
dollar blender. You can get them even cheaper on Facebook
Marketplace, both new and used.
Do you have any recommended supplements and
special ingredients?
As noted above, I will refer you to my Amazon store page for
special ingredients, but almost everything can be bought in
store as well.
7.

Some common ingredients in my recipes that aren’t typically
used in most home kitchens are vital wheat gluten, oat fiber,
xanthan gum, guar gum, diastatic malt powder, as well as
many more.
8. Some of these ingredients are expensive, are

they worth it/necessary?
That is something you are going to decide for yourself and
take on a case-by-case basis. For example, vital wheat gluten costs me about $20 for a 4 pound bag, but it lasts me
months. Not only that, but it has the same calories and macronutrient content of protein powder but is about ¼ of the
price. Xanthan gum costs also costs about $20 for a pound,
but even if you ate one ice cream per day, would last you well
over a year.
9. Can I substitute ingredients?

Yes, you can most certainly substitute ingredients. However,
I cannot guarantee perfect results if you try to directly substitute in ingredients. For example, coconut flour for regular
flour. You will have to use some trial and error and attempt
the recipe a few times, if not more, when an ingredient
that doesn’t substitute 1 to 1 is added. I highly recommend
researching anything you will substitute in before you waste
your time making a recipe for it to turn out at best mediocre
to at worst garbage.

10. Is measuring food ACTUALLY important?

Absolutely 100%.

In terms of reaching your desired physique, reaching a point
where you don’t have to measure out portions and can eat
intuitively without putting on extra weight is the end goal.
However, this is a process that takes time, effort, and repetition. Even though I can look at a plate and guess pretty accurately how many calories are on it, I still count my calories
when I am trying to lose weight. It takes all the guess work
out of it and will make it much easier to adjust your calories
if you aren’t losing weight.
For example, I had a client that was following a keto diet
and not counting calories before coming to me. He ended up
gaining 17 pounds over a 6-month period. Once he started
counting his daily caloric intake, he realized that every day
he was actually eating 300-500 calories more than what his
body needed to maintain his weight. That revelation completely changed his perspective, and he ended up losing
nearly 50 pounds over the following 7 months.
In terms of recipes, it is also very important. I have seen
firsthand cups and tablespoons measured wildly differently
and can cause the recipe itself to be ruined. The recipes
that include flour or xanthan gum are the most important.
Regardless, spending the $20-30 on a scale is well worth
the investment to make perfect recipes over and over again.
11. Why do some of the recipes call for extra meat/

sauce when the final recipe only needs a small
amount?
There are two main reasons for this.
The size of a piece of steak or chicken varies widely package
to package. One piece of steak may weigh 16 ounces while
another weighs 8 ounces. Also, chicken breasts are usually
sold in multiples, which complicates the situation even more.
It is easier to find a package of 3 breasts and cook them all at
once than to find just one, which leads me to my next point.
Prepping and cooking meat takes time and time is extremely
valuable to most people. It would be tedious to pound out,
brine, and cook one serving of meat every day, so instead I
list enough for multiple meals throughout the week. Then,
for the rest of the week, making the same dish will take a
fraction of the time it did the first day. However, there are no
rules in the kitchen and if you want to make one serving at a
time, that is 100% your call.

Frequently Asked Questions

DIET CHEAT CODES

12. What is the difference between cooked meat and

raw meat?
To keep it simple, cooked meat usually weighs 3/4 or 75%
of what raw meat does because of the water and fat that
releases during cooking.
For example, if a recipe calls for 112 grams of raw meat then,
once cooked, that same meat will weigh about 84 grams.
This value will be slightly different for different cuts of meat,
but this is a great ballpark to use. If you would like to be as
accurate as possible, weigh out your meat after it is cooked
and divide by the number of servings.

If you want to cover all your bases, you can add the calories from erythritol to your calorie tracking app on a recipe-by-recipe basis. I prefer to just add 100 calories at the end
of every day to “make up” for any calories I may have missed,
like calories coming from mustard, a few sprays of oil, or a
small amount of veggies.
17. Why do you use erythritol to sweeten

everything?
Out of all the sweeteners, erythritol is digested the best
while causing the least, if any, side effects.
Has the least calories per 100g of nearly every sweetener.

13. What should I do if I want to eat your cookie

It is the most cost effective.

dough recipe, but I don’t want to eat raw eggs
because I am worried about salmonella?
You have one of two options.

Erythritol replaces sugar in a 1-to-1 ratio in every brand I
have purchased so far.

You can pasteurize your own eggs, which is a fairly simple
process.

18. Can I substitute other sweeteners and/or brands

You can substitute the raw eggs for boxed egg whites which
are already pasteurized.
14. What should I do if a specific ingredient is out of

stock or unavailable in my country?
Please email me at CONTACT@EXERCISE4CHEATMEALS.
COM with the ingredient you are looking for and where you
live, and, if possible, I will come up with a solution.
15. What is erythritol?

Erythritol is an artificial sweetener or sugar substitute that is
used to sweeten foods without adding additional calories to
them. It is about 60-70% as sweet as table sugar. While technically a carbohydrate, it adds very little, if any, calories to a
recipe. It also does not affect blood sugar or insulin levels.
For example, my Lucky Charms Ice Cream has 45g of erythritol and it adds, at most, ten calories to the recipe. If the
same amount of sugar was added in place of erythritol, it
would add 180 calories to the recipe. That is more calories
than in the entire recipe itself!
16. Does erythritol have calories?

This is up for debate as I have seen studies cite that there are 0
calories in 100 grams of erythritol while others have said there
are up to 23 calories per 100 grams. For the purposes of continuity and transparency I did not count the potential calories
from erythritol because there is no clear evidence on the matter.

Frequently Asked Questions

for one another?
Yes, absolutely. I typically use Swerve® or Purecane® for my sweetener, but more companies have been popping up that make their
own brand of erythritol. I would use whatever you prefer, just try
to make sure it is a 1-to-1 ratio when replacing sugar.
However, it is important to note that different brands of
sweeteners have slightly different tastes, effects on a recipe,
and overall sweetness.
19. Why do you mention specific brands on some

recipes?
The first reason I mention specific brands is because that is
what I used and got me to the final dish you see in the pictures throughout the cookbook. Other brands will work, but
may produce a slightly different texture or taste. For example, there are other whey/casein protein powder blends, but
the flavor of the protein powder itself will also have a huge
impact on the taste of the dish. If the vanilla protein powder
you use isn’t that good in terms of flavor, it is more than likely
that your recipe won’t taste that good.
Secondly, there are just some brands that I find to be far
superior to others in terms of taste. Tomatoes are a great
example. Ethan Chlebowski actually did a phenomenal
video about canned tomatoes that you should check out at
some point. In his video, he asks the question, “Are the more
expensive tomatoes worth the price tag?” and then runs a
bunch of tests on them. I have found Cento® San Marzano
whole peeled tomatoes make for better sauces, dips, and are

DIET CHEAT CODES

just better tasting tomatoes overall. Again, feel free to use
other brands if there are ones you prefer.
Lastly, I pick specific brands because of the calories and
macros. For example, La Banderita® tortillas are only 45-80
calories a piece when most other tortillas are 110-220 calories for the same size tortilla. You may eat 2-3 tortillas in a
recipe which will save you hundreds of calories on your daily
caloric intake.
20. Why do some recipes have net carbs added to

them?
Put simply, net carbs are the amount of carbs in a given recipe that the body can actually utilize to store or use as energy
— AKA the carbs that have calories. For example, erythritol
is technically counted as a carb, but as it travels through
your body and is broken down, the body can’t metabolize it.
In turn, it can’t be used by the body as calories and is eventually excreted in your urine.
21. My baked recipe is dry and AWFUL. Why is this in

the cookbook?
There could be a variety of reasons that the recipe didn’t
come out as desired. Some recipes, such as my muffins,
could become dry if overcooked by 1-2 minutes. Other recipes may rely on fats and if substituted or eliminated completely, will totally alter the taste and texture of the dish. If
you have questions about a specific recipe, please email me
at CONTACT@EXERCISE4CHEATMEALS.COM and give me
as many details as possible as to how it was prepared and
cooked and what the issue was. If possible, I will try and
come up with a solution.
22. Why am I getting different calories when I input

the recipe into my calorie tracking app?
For a single ingredient, each brand can have a significant
difference in macros and total calories even if it is technically
the “same” product. Even the same brand can change their
manufacturer or ingredient list every few years causing the
exact same product to have different calories and macros.
In this TABLE , I added frequently used ingredients along
with the calorie count and macros I used to calculate the
total macros for any given recipe. I did this to keep as much
consistency as I could throughout the book, but if you want
to be as accurate as possible, log each product you use
manually into your calorie tracker.

23. Do I have to use fat-free milk in ice creams?

Absolutely not. I have heard of people using almond milk,
cashew milk, and several others. I think milk gives the most
authentic flavor of ice cream, but if you can’t drink cow’s milk
for whatever reason then feel free to use your milk of choice.
24. What if I need more detail than the instructions

have?
While I try to give as much detail as I can in each recipe
throughout the cookbook, there is only so much that can
be explained through words. If there are any additional
questions about a certain step and what it should look like
I highly suggest checking out my YouTube video on the recipe. If it still isn’t clear or you have further questions, e-mail
me at CONTACT@EXERCISE4CHEATMEALS.COM . I will try
and help you troubleshoot what may have gone wrong or
something else you may be able to try.
25. Why are some of the instructions or ingredients

different than your YouTube videos?
In the process of making this cookbook, I typed up and
made every single recipe I ever created. I wanted to make
sure each recipe lived up to my current cooking standard.
As I have gotten more and more experienced in the kitchen, I
have started using different techniques and ingredients that
have made my recipes better. If I made a recipe and felt it
didn’t reach this new standard I went back and tested the
recipe several times with slight tweaks as if I was going to
make a new video on it. Although many of the recipes are
the same as when they were posted, there are a handful I
went back through and updated to make a tastier and more
flavorful dish.
26. What if my dough is too dry or too wet?

Luckily, the solution is pretty simple, but the reasons for why
it’s happening are pretty complex. If you are making a recipe
that includes dough and it’s either too wet or too dry, you
will need to:
• Add 5-10g of liquid.
• Add 5-10g of flour.
If you have to add more flour, just note that for next time and
use less liquid so you don’t have to add calories to the dish.
Although I test every recipe several times to make sure it can
be universally used, dough can be affected by the season,
the humidity or lack thereof, the brand of flour, and more.
