# Diet Cheat Codes - Overview

*A comprehensive guide to making delicious, low-calorie versions of your favorite foods.*

## Why Do My Recipes Work?

**It Boils Down To 2 Words: Balance and Taste**

Before I explain, I have a question for you: *What are some of your fondest childhood memories?*

One of mine was hearing the ice cream truck coming down the street. I would run to my dad and ask him for a dollar so I could go buy an ice cream bar that had those gumballs that lost their flavor in less than 2 minutes. Another one was going to DiCola’s every time I would visit my grandparents. DiCola’s is a well-known seafood restaurant in Chicago that has the best colossal shrimp, clam strips, and tomato bread I have ever had. Since they had no indoor seating, we would eat our meal in the car or on a piece of wood that was in the parking lot.

Lastly, were the days my dad worked late. Why? He wouldn’t have time to cook so we would go to Bill’s Place, a local restaurant, to pick up dinner. I would either get a gyro, a ham and cheese pita (not-so-coincidentally also in this book), or a slice of pizza.

Some of my greatest memories revolved around food and with over 30 years of these experiences, it would be near impossible to change. For as long as I can remember, my goal has been to develop a diet that I could adhere to indefinitely. After several years of attempting to only eat “clean foods” and completely depriving myself of the foods I always loved, I realized I needed to try and make my favorite foods fit into my day-to-day diet. If I didn’t, I would fail each and every time I dieted.

### How Does This Relate to My Recipes Working?

Since then, my goal has been to make every recipe as close to “Chicago good” as possible, while also striking a balance between lower calories, higher protein, and sufficient volume to feel full and satisfied. If you are from Chicago, you know how spoiled we are with great food from every culture, so “Chicago good” simply means having the most flavor and being as delicious as humanly possible.

The best part about the recipes I create is that most of them are low enough in calories that it allows for going on dinner dates, having a few drinks, or indulging in some Krispy Kreme® donuts without worrying about gaining weight. This is pivotal for anyone and everyone that has a thriving social life, significant other, and/or likes trying new food and restaurants.

In this book you will be able to make pizza, ice cream, famous fast food items, burgers, and more — and all these recipes taste nearly as good as the full calorie version. Because of this, you will never have to sacrifice the foods you love because of your “diet.”

## Pantry Essentials

There are ingredients I like to have in my pantry and then there are ingredients I **NEED** to have in my pantry. Everything listed below is in my pantry or fridge 24/7 and work in unison with one another.

* **Vital Wheat Gluten:** If you are going to be baking any bread or making any pizzas, I would highly recommend having a bag of vital wheat gluten in your pantry. It has the same grams of protein per serving as protein powder, but costs a fraction of the price.
* **Erythritol:** Erythritol is an artificial sweetener or sugar substitute that is used to sweeten recipes without adding additional calories to them. The two brands I use are Swerve® and Purecane®. I would get both a granulated version and brown sugar version.
* **Flour:** Essential. If you are only going to buy one, get all-purpose flour. If you want to splurge, get King Arthur® bread flour as well.
* **Protein Powder:** The protein powder I use is a whey/casein blend (specifically PEScience). Make sure you get a whey/casein blend. If you only have one flavor, make it vanilla.
* **Instant Yeast:** Essential for pizzas, buns, and bread. Keep it in the freezer after opening.
* **Corn Meal:** Used for Deep Dish Pizza and for unloading pizzas from a peel onto a steel.
* **Cocoa Powder:** I recommend Dutch cocoa powder. If making cookies n' cream recipes, get black cocoa powder.
* **Xanthan Gum:** Thickens and emulsifies recipes (crucial for protein ice creams). Guar gum is also recommended for ice creams.
* **Black Pepper:** Always freshly cracked.
* **Red Pepper Flakes:** Adds spice without changing the base taste.
* **Salt:** Essential. I use iodized salt, but kosher works too.
* **Dried Spices:** Essential 5: Red pepper flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and paprika.
* **Aromatics:** Onions, garlic, scallions.
* **Extra-Virgin Olive Oil:** Essential for savory foods.
* **Fresh Herbs:** Parsley and cilantro.
* **Lemon/Lime:** Juice for marinades/sauces, zest for garnish.
* **Tomatoes:** Canned San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes (Cento® brand recommended) and tomato paste.
* **Avocado Oil:** Great source of mono-saturated fat, neutral flavor for baking.
* **Chipotle Peppers:** Canned in adobo sauce. Adds smoky, spicy flavor.
* **Condiments:** No sugar added ketchup, mustard, Sriracha, no sugar added BBQ sauce, light mayonnaise, soy sauce, hot sauce, buffalo sauce.
* **Parmigiano Reggiano:** Worth the money. A few grams goes a long way.
* **Mozzarella:** Fat-free and part-skim blocks (shred it yourself).
* **Eggs:** Essential. Keep liquid egg whites on hand too.
* **Milk:** Fairlife® recommended (double the protein), but regular works.

---

## Kitchen Gear

* **Pizza Steel:** If you make pizzas or dough, buy one. It browns the bottom of a pizza unlike anything else. I recommend a 16”x16”.
* **Pizza Peel:** Makes life 10x easier to shoot pizzas into the oven. Match the size to your steel.

## Cooking Techniques

### Preparing Chicken Breasts

It took me more than 10 years to make chicken breasts that I can enjoy without any sauces, oils, or seasonings. Just salt and chicken. Don’t make dry and bland chicken like I did for over a decade.

1. **Trim your chicken breasts:** Use kitchen scissors to remove visible tendons and fat. Flip the breast to find the tendon running down the middle and cut it out.
2. **Tenderize your meat:** Place chicken in a gallon bag. Using the flat side of a meat tenderizer, pound gently from the center out until about a half-inch thick.
3. **Salt your chicken:** This retains moisture. I usually dry brine or marinade overnight.

### Brining / Dry Brining Meat

* **Wet Brine:** 5% salt to water ratio (5g salt per 100g water). Submerge meat, refrigerate for 1-12 hours.
* **Dry Brine:** 1.5% salt to meat ratio (1.5g salt per 100g meat). Coat evenly. Refrigerate uncovered for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.

### Roasting Vegetables

* **Slow Roast:** Chop veggies, toss with light oil/seasoning. Bake at 400°F for 20-40 mins, tossing halfway.
* **Broil:** Preheat broiler. Place whole veggies (like peppers) 3-4" from heat. Broil 3-10 mins until charred. Peel skin after cooling.

### Roasted Garlic

1. Chop off the top of a garlic head to expose cloves.
2. Spray with oil, add salt/pepper.
3. Wrap in foil and bake at 400°F for 45 minutes.

### Kneading Dough

1. Lightly dust surface with flour.
2. Press dough down and away with the heel of your hand.
3. Fold in half, press down and away.
4. Repeat until smooth and elastic (5-10 mins).

### Pickling Vegetables

1. Slice vegetables and place in a jar.
2. Boil equal parts water and vinegar with salt (15-30g per 1000g liquid) and spices (garlic, peppercorns, dill).
3. Pour hot liquid over veggies. Let cool, then refrigerate.

### Blooming Spices

1. Add oil to a hot pan (or create a "dugout" in the middle of food).
2. Add spices to the hot oil.
3. Cook for 30-60 seconds until fragrant, then combine with food.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Should I eat every meal exclusively from this cookbook?**
While you certainly can, it’s not necessary. I typically eat 1-2 meals from the book everyday while also rounding out my other meals with simple snacks, fruits, vegetables, and leftovers.

**2. Am I guaranteed to lose weight if I eat from this cookbook?**
No. Regardless of food choices, if you are in a calorie surplus, you will gain weight. You must track your intake.

**3. Are the nutrition facts 100% accurate?**
No, but they are as accurate as possible. Labels round numbers, and ingredients vary.

**4. How do I accurately track recipes that use breading or marinades?**
It is tedious to calculate perfectly (weighing before and after). I recommend adding a buffer of ~100 calories to your daily log to account for variables like marinades and oils.

**5. Do you have any recommended kitchen equipment?**
Yes, see the **Kitchen Gear** section. A Creami® or Ninja® blender is key for ice creams; a pizza steel is key for pizzas.

**6. Does it matter what blender I use for ice creams?**
Yes! I recommend the Ninja® blender. I broke 2 others trying to make protein ice cream.

**7. Do you have any recommended supplements and special ingredients?**
See the **Pantry Essentials** section. Common special ingredients include vital wheat gluten, oat fiber, xanthan gum, etc.

**8. Some of these ingredients are expensive, are they worth it?**
Vital wheat gluten ($20) lasts months and is cheaper than protein powder per serving. Xanthan gum lasts over a year. It is usually worth the investment.

**9. Can I substitute ingredients?**
Yes, but I cannot guarantee results. Coconut flour does *not* sub 1:1 for regular flour.

**10. Is measuring food ACTUALLY important?**
Absolutely 100%. A food scale ($20-30) is worth the investment to ensure recipes turn out correctly and calorie counts are accurate.

**11. Why do some recipes call for extra meat/sauce when the final recipe only needs a small amount?**
Batch cooking saves time. I list enough for multiple meals so you don't have to prep every single day.

**12. What is the difference between cooked meat and raw meat?**
Cooked meat usually weighs 75% of raw meat due to water loss. If a recipe calls for 112g raw, it will weigh about 84g cooked.

**13. What should I do if I want cookie dough but am worried about raw eggs?**
Use pasteurized eggs or carton egg whites.

**14. What if an ingredient is unavailable in my country?**
Email me for potential solutions.

**15. What is erythritol?**
A sugar substitute with very few calories that does not affect blood sugar. It allows for sweetness without the massive calorie load of sugar.

**16. Does erythritol have calories?**
Debatable (0 to 23 cal per 100g). For this book, I treat it as 0, but you can add a buffer calorie count if you prefer.

**17. Why do you use erythritol to sweeten everything?**
It digests best with fewest side effects, is cost-effective, and replaces sugar 1-to-1.

**18. Can I substitute other sweeteners?**
Yes, just try to keep the 1-to-1 ratio.

**19. Why do you mention specific brands?**
Because those are the specific products I used to get the macronutrient counts and flavor profiles listed. Different brands (like tomatoes) can taste vastly different.

**20. Why do some recipes have net carbs added to them?**
Net carbs are the carbs your body actually utilizes. Erythritol is a carb but isn't metabolized, so it is subtracted.

**21. My baked recipe is dry and AWFUL. Why?**
Overcooking by even 1-2 minutes or substituting fats can ruin texture.

**22. Why am I getting different calories when I input the recipe into my app?**
Brands vary significantly. For 100% accuracy, log the specific brands you are using in your kitchen.

**23. Do I have to use fat-free milk in ice creams?**
No. Use whatever milk fits your diet/digestion, but cow's milk offers the most authentic flavor.

**24. What if I need more detail than the instructions have?**
Check the YouTube video for the specific recipe to see visual cues.

**25. Why are some instructions different than your YouTube videos?**
I updated recipes for the book to meet my current cooking standards, which have improved over time.

**26. What if my dough is too dry or too wet?**

* Too dry: Add 5-10g liquid.
* Too wet: Add 5-10g flour.
Humidity, flour brand, and season can all affect dough.

# $1 PAN PIZZA

**Serves:** 5 | **Prep:** 1 HR | **Cook:** 13 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 651 | 14 | 91 | N/A | 40 |

## Ingredients

### DOUGH

- 500g all-purpose flour
- 100g vital wheat gluten
- 10g salt
- 5g instant yeast
- 440g water

### SAUCE

- 28oz can Cento® crushed tomatoes
- 1.5g garlic powder
- 6g salt, or to taste

### PIZZA BUILD

- Oil spray
- 1 Dough
- 80g Sauce
- 60g part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded

## Directions

1. Place flour, vital wheat gluten, yeast, and salt into a food processor and process for 30 seconds.
2. Turn processor on high, slowly mix in water over a 30-60 second period, and let dough mixture process for an additional 30-60 seconds.
3. Plop dough onto the counter, roll it into a ball, and divide the dough into 5 pieces. Each piece should weigh roughly 200-210g.
4. Form each dough into individual balls by flattening the dough with your fingers, folding each side of the dough into the middle, flipping it over, and rolling it in a circular motion until a ball is formed.
5. Grab 5 high sided containers, lightly spray oil into each one, put one dough ball into each container, spray the top of the dough ball, cover with a lid, and put any dough that will not be used in the next hour or two in the fridge.
6. In a separate high-sided container, add the can of tomatoes, garlic powder, and salt. Stir to combine, cover with a lid, and refrigerate.
7. Spray oil onto your hands and an oven safe pan, plop dough into the middle, start stretching it towards the corners of the pan, and spread it to your desired size and thickness. If the dough keeps snapping back, cover it for 15 minutes, then come back and finish stretching. This gives the dough time to relax.
8. Add sauce and spread evenly over the dough with the back of a spoon. Top with mozzarella cheese and bake in a preheated 425°F oven for 12-14 minutes or until cheese is golden brown.
9. Using a spatula, check the bottom of the pizza to make sure it is golden brown as well. If it isn't, you can put it on the stovetop on medium heat and check it every minute or two until it is cooked to your preference.

## Tips

Dough can be stored in the fridge up to a week and actually develops MORE flavor over time. You can store any unused dough by spreading it out in a lightly oiled gallon bag, freezing it, and removing it about an hour before they need to be used.

TIP: You can use pre-packaged frozen strawberries or buy your own from the store. If you buy fresh from the produce sections just cut off the stem of the strawberries and add them to a plastic bag. They should be frozen and ready to go in just a few hours. TIP: If you want an even deeper strawberry flavor, substitute some of the ice for frozen strawberries. Just make sure you account for any changes in your calorie tracking. Also, depending on the freshness and sweetness of your strawberries you may need to add more or less granulated erythritol.

# BURRITO TORTILLAS

**Serves:** 2 | **Prep:** 60 MINS | **Cook:** 3 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 177 | 4 | 37 | 22 | 14 |

## Ingredients

### DRY

- 42g all-purpose flour
- 30g vital wheat gluten
- 30g oat fiber
- 2g baking powder
- 2g salt
- 2g xanthan gum

### WET

- 6g avocado oil
- 85g water

## Directions

1. Add Dry Ingredients into a medium-sized bowl and whisk to combine.
2. In a separate bowl, mix the Wet Ingredients together, add to the Dry Ingredients, and mix with a spoon until most of the ingredients come together.
3. Dump the contents of the bowl onto the counter and use hands to incorporate until there are no more dry parts left in the dough.
4. Finish kneading this dough by squeezing dough for 30-60 seconds, switching hands with each squeeze.
5. Divide dough in half, form into balls, cover with a damp towel or wrap each ball individually with plastic wrap, and rest dough for 30 minutes.
6. Dust counter with flour, plop a dough ball down, dust top of the dough with flour, and roll out using a rolling pin. If dough starts sticking to the rolling pin, add more flour where it is sticking, spread, and continue. I like to roll the dough 4-5 times then turn it 90 degrees, roll 4-5 times again, and repeat.
7. Once rolled out to 11-12", place underneath a damp tea towel or kitchen towel to prevent the tortilla from drying out.
8. Repeat with the second tortilla and place on a preheated cast iron or griddle on medium-high heat.
9. Cook each side for 30-60 seconds, flip, and cook another 30-60 seconds.
10. Put under a separate wet tea towel or kitchen towel until cool.
11. Use right away or fold and place in a plastic bag for up to 3-4 days.

## Tips

If storing for later use, put tortilla in the microwave for 10 seconds when ready to eat. If making a large batch and need to avoid molding, fold twice, place in a gallon bag, and throw into the freezer. When ready to use cover with a damp tea towel or paper towel and reheat for 30 seconds.

## Notes

I include an extra 8g into the macros of all-purpose flour that is used to roll the tortilla out, even though it is not included in the ingredient list itself.

3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.
4. Lightly oil a clean bowl, place the dough in it, and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.
5. Gently deflate the dough and divide it into 4 equal pieces.
6. Shape each piece into a rectangle, about 6-8 inches long.
7. Fold one long side of the rectangle over to meet the other long side, sealing the seam by pinching along the edge.
8. Roll the sealed dough gently to create a more even ciabatta shape.
9. Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal. Place the shaped ciabatta loaves on the baking sheet, seam side down.
10. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise for another 30-45 minutes, or until noticeably puffy.
11. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
12. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped on the bottom.

# HOAGIE ROLLS

**Serves:** 4 | **Prep:** 3.5 HRS | **Cook:** 13 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 308 | 3 | 50 | N/A | 20 |

## Ingredients

### DRY

- 240g King Arthur® bread flour
- 60g vital wheat gluten
- 8g dough conditioner
- 6g diastatic malt powder
- 2.5g instant yeast
- 5g salt

### WET

- 10g Crisco®
- 192g water
- Corn meal
- 56g water (oven)

## Directions

1. Add all dry ingredients to a food processor and mix for 60 seconds.
2. Add Crisco® to the food processor and start blending for 10 seconds. As the processor is blending, add water over a 20 second period and continue mixing for 30 seconds.
3. Plop the dough on the counter, knead for 6-8 minutes, and divide into 4 equal sized pieces of dough. Each dough should weigh about 129g.
4. Roll each piece of dough into a ball, making sure the bottom of the ball is sealed. Line a baking pan with a nonstick liner, space dough balls evenly apart, and cover for 90 minutes.
5. Flip one piece of dough bottom side up and gently roll the dough back and forth with a rolling pin. Continue rolling until about a quarter inch thick.
6. Pick up the dough and place onto the counter in the shape of a square. Roll out the edges to get an even thickness.
7. The dough should be about 6" wide and 6.5" long.
8. Take the top of the dough and fold about half of it onto itself. Using the tips of your fingers, press the edge of the dough into the crease.
9. Take the bottom of the dough and fold it up. It should perfectly line up to the top corners of the dough. Seal the roll by pinching along the edge and sides of the dough. The roll should be about 6" long.
10. Dust a nonstick liner with corn meal and place the hoagie roll directly on the corn meal.
11. Repeat for the other pieces of dough and cover for 90 minutes.
12. Add a steel brownie pan to the bottom rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 425°F.
13. Add a piece of parchment paper to a pizza peel or a cookie sheet.
14. Grab each piece of dough from the bottom, lightly stretch it out from the middle for a couple seconds, and place them on the pizza peel, making sure to evenly space them out. The roll should be about 8" long.
15. Make a cut down the middle of each roll with a sharp knife or bread lame.
16. Heat up 56g water in a microwave for 30-40 seconds or until boiling.
17. Using oven mitts, add the hoagies to a baking steel, pour the water into the brownie pan, and quickly shut the oven door.
18. Bake for 12-14 minutes and immediately transfer to a wire rack to cool.

## Tips

If you don't have a baking steel, you can cook these on a sheet pan with a nonstick liner. There is only 1 difference. About 3-4 minutes before the rolls are finished baking, you will have to flip them to ensure the bottom of the hoagie browns correctly.

# PROTEIN BAGUETTE

**Serves:** 8 | **Prep:** 3 HRS | **Cook:** 25 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 321 | 1 | 59 | N/A | 20 |

## Ingredients

- 600g King Arthur® bread flour
- 100g vital wheat gluten
- 500g warm water
- 16g salt
- 15g instant yeast
- 50g water (yeast)

## Directions

1. Add bread flour and vital wheat gluten into a large bowl and whisk.
2. Pour lukewarm water into the bowl and using a spoon, mix everything together until it becomes a shaggy dough.
3. Rinse your hand under water and use your wet hand to mix the dough until there are no more dry parts.
4. Once finished, top dough evenly with salt, and cover for 20 minutes.
5. While waiting, put yeast and water into a glass and mix yeast using a spoon until yeast is covered in water.
6. Add yeast mixture onto the dough and using a wet hand, squeeze the dough repeatedly for 4-5 minutes or until the yeast mixture and salt is completely mixed into the dough. Use your hand to squeeze one part of the dough through my fingers, then move to another part and repeat while occasionally flipping the dough.
7. Cover the dough for 30 minutes.
8. Using a wet hand, perform a stretch and fold by pulling one side of the dough as high as possible then folding it over itself.
9. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and repeat 3-4 more times until all dough has been stretched.
10. Flip the dough over, and form into a ball by sliding your hand underneath the dough and pulling it in a circular motion towards your body. When the ball is formed, the dough should have a fairly smooth surface and look like kneaded dough.
11. Cover the dough for 30 minutes, repeat steps 8-10, spray the top of the dough with oil, and cover for 90 minutes.
12. Lightly dust work surface and top of the dough with flour, degas the dough by punching it down, and flip it onto the work surface.
13. Using a bread scraper, divide the dough into four roughly 310g pieces and put three of them to the side.
14. To prevent sticking, spray hands with oil and push the dough outward to get any big air bubbles out.
15. Fold the sides of the dough, followed by the top and bottom of the dough, flip the dough over, and round it into a ball making sure the bottom of the dough is sticking together.
16. Put the dough ball off to the side, cover with a damp tea towel, and repeat with the other 3 pieces of dough.
17. Let the dough rest for 20 minutes, grab a sheet pan, line it with parchment paper, lightly spray with oil, and put it off to the side.
18. Lightly dust surface with flour, put one of the dough balls in front of you bottom side up, put a little bit of oil on your hands, and press the dough out into a roughly 8x6" rectangular shape while getting any massive air bubbles out.
19. Take the top of the dough and fold about a quarter of it onto itself. Using the tips of your fingers, press the edge of the dough into the crease.
20. Slowly roll the dough down by continually pressing the seams together with each roll and popping any large air bubbles while doing so.
21. Seal the roll by pinching along the edge, lightly dust with flour, and put the sealed side on the work surface.
22. Using both hands, start in the middle of the dough and slowly apply pressure both down and out while trying to keep the seam side down the entire time.
23. Each time the dough is rolled out, apply more pressure, especially at the ends of the dough to give it an authentic baguette taper. The usually takes about 3-5 rolls and should be about 12-14" in length.
24. Put the rolled dough on the parchment paper, cover with a sheet pan, and repeat for the remaining dough balls, making sure the pieces of dough are evenly spaced out on the sheet pan.
25. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 60-90 minutes. Try and make sure the rolled pieces of dough are as straight as possible before rising or else they will most likely be crooked.
26. Spray the baguettes with water, score the baguettes with a bread lame or a sharp knife every 2 inches or down the middle. Bake in a preheated 450°F oven with a small cast iron pan preheating on the rack below. Add 5-6 pieces of ice to the hot cast iron pan when you add the baguettes to the oven and close the oven door. (This creates steam to give your baguettes a better rise while baking.)
27. Bake for 25-30 minutes, flipping the sheet pan around halfway through and moving the bread on the inside of the pan to the outside and vice versa.
28. Baguettes are done when you can knock on them and they sound hollow. Let them cool and store any you will not use that day in the freezer.

## Tips

To reheat from the freezer, simply put baguette into a preheated 350° oven for 15 minutes and it will be as good as new.

# PROTEIN PITA

**Serves:** 2 | **Prep:** 15 MINS | **Cook:** 3 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 106 | 3 | 19 | 13 | 8 |

## Ingredients

### DRY

- 30g all-purpose flour
- 18g vital wheat gluten
- 12g oat fiber
- 1.5g salt
- 2g baking powder

### WET

- 4g extra virgin olive oil
- 54g water

## Directions

1. Add Dry Ingredients to a bowl and whisk together.
2. Add olive oil to the Dry Ingredients and mix the oil into the ingredients so it is spread evenly.
3. Add water to the bowl and using a spoon, incorporate the mixture as much as possible.
4. Flip the dough out onto the counter and continue incorporating all the ingredients into the dough making sure there are no dry parts.
5. Squeeze dough ball between fingers, switch hands, and repeat for one minute. This will make sure everything is evenly dispersed throughout.
6. Split dough into two balls.
7. Lightly dust counter and rolling pin with flour, put one dough ball down, and add a light dusting of flour to the top of the dough.
8. Roll dough 2-3 times, turn 90°, roll 2-3 times, and repeat until the dough is about 6" wide and 1/8-1/4" thick. If dough starts to stick to the rolling pin, lightly dust the surface where the dough is sticking, spread around, and continue rolling.
9. Lightly spray a cast iron pan on medium-high heat, place one rolled out piece of dough onto the pan, and cook each side for 1-2 minutes or until browning occurs.
10. Put cooked pita under a damp towel to prevent drying out and repeat for the other pita.

## Tips

Letting the dough balls relax for 15 minutes after step 6 will make the dough easier to roll out. Cook 3-4 batches at a time so that you have enough for multiple days. If you won't eat all of the pitas within 3-4 days, I would freeze them and reheat them in the microwave or on a skillet.

# BANANA BREAD MUFFINS

**Serves:** 13 | **Prep:** 15 MINS | **Cook:** 17 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 101 | 3 | 12 | N/A | 7 |

## Ingredients

### WET

- 360g banana
- 2 eggs
- 10g unsalted butter, melted
- 11g avocado oil
- 4.2g vanilla extract
- 80g brown sugar erythritol

### DRY

- 85g all-purpose flour
- 93g PEScience Snickerdoodle protein powder
- 7g ground cinnamon
- 3g salt
- 4g baking powder
- 2g baking soda

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, add bananas and break them down using a fork or an immersion blender.
2. Add the Wet Ingredients to the bowl and whisk to combine.
3. In another large bowl, add the Dry Ingredients and whisk to combine.
4. Add Dry Ingredients into the bowl of the Wet Ingredients and whisk until just BARELY combined — overmixing will result in chewy muffins. To make sure everything is combined, fold the mixture 3-4 times and scrape the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula.
5. Line 13 muffin liners on a sheet pan, add 58g of muffin mix to each liner, and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 16-18 minutes. You know they are done when a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin has some crumbs sticking to it, but nothing wet.
6. Store muffins in a paper towel lined air-tight container or simply throw them in a plastic bag and enjoy for the next 3-4 days.

## Tips

If you want a moister muffin, pull them about one minute before they are done. They will be slightly underdone, but it'll make them so much more flavorful in my opinion.

2. Dip slices of bread one at a time in the wet mixture, soak for one minute, flip, and let bread soak on the other side for an additional minute.
3. Lightly spray a preheated pan on medium heat with oil. Place a soaked slice of bread into the pan.
4. Repeat for the additional slices. Lightly spray top of french toast with oil spray and let them cook for 20 minutes, flipping halfway through.
5. While the french toast cooks, add butter, cream cheese, and salt into a large bowl. Blend for 5 minutes using a hand mixer.
6. Add cake batter extract and vanilla extract to the bowl and continue mixing for an additional 3 minutes.
7. In 3 parts, add confectioners erythritol to the bowl. Add more sweetener once each part is fully mixed in. This blend should take 5 minutes in total.
8. When finished mixing, add sprinkles and fold into frosting.
9. Put frosting into a plastic container and refrigerate.
10. Add one slice of french toast to your plate, top with 1/3 of the frosting, spread evenly, and repeat for the other two slices of French toast.
11. Let's eat.

## Tips

If there is extra egg mixture leftover, pour it on top of the bread before spraying the french toast with oil. Pause halfway through to scrape down the sides of the bowl, then continue mixing. You can use the frosting right away, but it tastes best after sitting in the fridge for 1-2 hours.

- 8g brown sugar erythritol
- 1g black pepper
- 0.8g ground nutmeg
- 1g cayenne pepper
- 1g paprika
- 12.5g powdered nonfat dairy milk

## Directions

1. Put all ingredients into a bowl, mix thoroughly, and form into 46.5g balls.
2. Flatten balls to about a ¼-½ inch thick patty and add to a preheated pan on medium heat. You should hear that sizzle as soon as it hits the pan.
3. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, until lightly brown.

## Tips

Have sage or thyme, but need to grind it down? Use a food processor or coffee grinder to do so. It becomes ground sage or thyme in seconds. Spray hands with oil for an easier time forming patties. Let meat mixture sit in the fridge up to 24 hours to amplify the flavor profile.

# JAPANESE PANCAKES

**Serves:** 1 | **Prep:** 10 MINS | **Cook:** 10 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 350 | 11 | 45 | 20 | 39 |

## Ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 40g fat-free milk
- 2.1g vanilla extract
- Pinch salt (~.4 grams)
- 19g all-purpose flour
- 30g PEScience Gourmet Vanilla protein powder
- 1g baking powder
- 25g granulated erythritol
- Dash cream of tartar

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, separate egg whites from the yolks and place yolks in a separate bowl.
2. Add milk, vanilla extract, and salt to the yolks.
3. Into the egg yolk mixture, sift flour, protein powder, and baking powder. You can do this by using a strainer and gently shaking the flour-laden strainer until it is empty. Whisk to combine.
4. Start blending the egg whites using a hand mixer on low speed. When it begins to foam, add ¼ of the erythritol at a time, and add more once the sweetener is completely mixed in.
5. Once the erythritol has been completely mixed in, the egg whites should be very close to forming stiff peaks and it is time to add the cream of tartar and mix for an additional 30 seconds or until stiff peaks have formed.
6. Take a quarter of the meringue and vigorously mix it into the egg yolk mixture.
7. Take the remaining meringue, pour it on top, and gently fold it in until the mixture has JUST BARELY come together. The goal here is to not overwork the batter because that will cause the pancake to be noticeably less fluffy.
8. Transfer finished batter to a plastic gallon bag and when ready to cook, cut the corner of the bag off.
9. Lightly spray a preheated pan on low with oil and pipe batter into the pan where the middle of the pancake will be. Let gravity do the work while slowing raising the bag up as the pancake gets taller and spreads out.
10. Repeat for the other pancakes, add a few drops of water into the pan, and cover.
11. Let pancakes cook for 3-5 minutes, lightly spray the top of each pancake, flip, and cover.
12. Let the pancakes cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, plate it, pour some sugar-free syrup on top, and enjoy!

## Directions

1. Add the erythritol, sugar, and salt to a large bowl and place a mesh strainer over the bowl.
2. Add the remaining dry ingredients to the strainer and sift them into the bowl. If you only have vanilla whey/casein protein powder, it will work, but it may reduce the chocolaty flavor—add 5-10g extra cocoa powder to compensate.
3. Press any remaining chunks through the strainer, and pour any leftover remnants into the bowl.
4. Thoroughly whisk the dry ingredients, then use a spoon to create a well in the middle of the bowl.
5. Pour all the wet ingredients into the well and whisk ONLY the wet ingredients until fully combined.

7. Line a jumbo muffin pan with large baking cups, lightly spray each cup with oil to prevent sticking, and add 160g of batter into each cup.
8. Evenly top each muffin with chocolate chips and bake in a preheated 300°F oven for 38-42 minutes. The muffins are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few crumbs but no wet batter.
9. Allow the muffins to cool on a wire rack for 1 hour or until the chocolate hardens.
10. Store them in an airtight container lined with a paper towel, or simply place them in a plastic bag. Enjoy within 3-4 days.

## Tips

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, add the Wet ingredients and whisk to combine.

5. While the muffins are baking, prepare the glaze by microwaving butter in a small bowl in ten second intervals until melted.
6. In a medium bowl, add the melted butter, powdered sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest for the glaze. Whisk to combine.
7. Put parchment paper below a wire rack, add hot muffins to the rack, top each muffin with glaze, and spread the glaze around the top of the muffin using a spatula.
8. Store muffins in a paper towel lined air-tight container and enjoy for the next 3-4 days.

## Tips

If you want a moister muffin, pull them about one minute before they are done. They will be slightly underdone, but it'll make them so much more flavorful in my opinion.

# PUMPKIN PIE MUFFINS

**Serves:** 13 | **Prep:** 15 MINS | **Cook:** 17 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 97 | 3 | 14 | 11 | 7 |

## Ingredients

### WET

- 120g banana
- 240g pure pumpkin
- 2 eggs
- 21g avocado oil
- 4.2g vanilla extract
- 40g brown sugar erythritol (add 20g if using PEScience Multipurpose protein powder)
- 40g granulated erythritol (add 20g if using PEScience Multipurpose protein powder)

### DRY

- 90g all-purpose flour
- 93g PEScience Pumpkin Pie protein powder (90g PEScience Multipurpose protein powder if sold out)
- 3g pumpkin spice (6g if using PEScience Multipurpose protein powder)
- 7g ground cinnamon
- 3g salt
- 4g baking powder
- 2g baking soda

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, add bananas and break them down using a fork or an immersion blender.
2. In a large bowl, add the Wet Ingredients and whisk to combine.
3. In another large bowl, add the Dry Ingredients and whisk to combine.
4. Add Dry Ingredients into the bowl of the Wet Ingredients and whisk until just BARELY combined — overmixing will result in chewy muffins. To make sure everything is combined, fold the mixture 3-4 times and scrape the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula.
5. Line 13 muffin liners on a sheet pan, add 59g of muffin mix to each liner, and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 16-18 minutes. You know they are done when a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin has some crumbs sticking to it, but nothing wet.
6. Store muffins in a paper towel lined air-tight container or simply throw them in a plastic bag and enjoy for the next 3-4 days.

## Tips

If you want a moister muffin, pull them about one minute before they are done. They will be slightly underdone, but it'll make them so much more flavorful in my opinion.

## Ingredients

### CHEESECAKE FILLING

- 60g 2% cottage cheese
- 56g low-fat cream cheese
- 56g fat-free cream cheese
- 1 egg yolk
- 15g granulated sugar
- 20g erythritol
- 1g salt
- 2g imitation vanilla

- 19g Gorilla Mind Vanilla Ice Cream protein

### WAFFLE

- 50g PEScience Waffle & Pancake Mix
- 16.2g Gorilla Mode Vanilla Ice Cream protein
- 90g water
- 108g Cheesecake Filling

## Directions

1. Place waffle mix and protein in a large bowl and whisk.
2. Add water and whisk until a batter forms.
3. Minus the 40 grams of chopped strawberries, add all cheesecake filling ingredients into a high-sided container and using an immersion blender mix for 2 minutes. You can use a blender cup to do this as well. You may need to scrape down the sides a few times to fully combine.
4. Put the chopped strawberries in the container and stir to evenly distribute.
5. Add 108 grams of the cheesecake filling to a small bowl and refrigerate the rest.
6. Into a preheated Stüffler® waffle maker, add a layer of waffle batter so the bottom grids and waffle divider are thinly, but completely covered.
7. Place the cheesecake filling in the center of the waffle maker. Make sure it is evenly spread out and is about a half inch from the edges of the waffle maker.
8. Cover the filling with the remaining batter until it reaches the top of the square projections on the waffle tongs.
9. Close the waffle maker, flip, and cook for 5-6 minutes.
10. Let the waffle cool for 2 minutes and cut in half. If you wait too long, the filling may be over cooked.

## Notes

You can use any premade waffle mix that you would like. However, you may need to adjust the amount of water used and macros as needed. One batch of cheesecake filling makes enough for 3 waffles.

# BASQUE CHEESECAKE

**Serves:** 8 | **Prep:** 25 MINS | **Cook:** 35 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 372 | 15 | 47 | 28 | 29 |

## Ingredients

- 325g 2% cottage cheese, blended
- 448g low-fat cream cheese
- 224g fat-free cream cheese
- 100g granulated sugar
- 150g erythritol
- 4g salt
- 8g imitation vanilla
- 3 eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- 480g 2% milk
- 40g all-purpose flour
- 97.2g Gorilla Mind Vanilla Ice Cream protein

## Directions

1. Allow cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, and milk to come to room temperature. This will take about 2-4 hours.
2. Add eggs and yolks to a medium bowl.
3. Using an immersion blender, mix the cottage cheese for 2 minutes or until smooth.
4. Add flour and protein to a medium bowl and whisk.
5. Add cottage cheese, cream cheese, sugar, erythritol, salt, and vanilla to a large bowl.
6. Using a hand mixer, blend for 2 minutes on low or until everything is combined. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. You can make this entire recipe whisking by hand or with a stand mixer. Whichever option you choose, just follow the instructions as listed.
7. While mixing on low, add in one egg/yolk at a time until it is fully combined. This should take about 5 minutes in total. Scrape down sides and bottom of bowl.
8. Slowly pour in milk while mixing on low. Once all milk is poured in, scrape down sides of bowl and mix for an additional minute.
9. Add flour/protein mixture to a mesh strainer and sift the powder over the bowl while mixing on low. Once all powder is sifted, mix for one minute and scrape down sides. Mix for an additional minute or until everything is combined.
10. Spray a 10" springform pan with oil, place on a sheet pan, and add mixture to springform pan. You can place parchment paper inside of the springform pan before pouring for easier removal and transfer of the cheesecake. This works for other round 10" pans as well.
11. Bake in a preheated 475°F oven for 35-40 minutes or until brown on top with a slight jiggle throughout the cheesecake. Turn sheet pan halfway through cooking.
12. Allow cheesecake to set for 2-4 hours before cutting into it. The goal is to have a custard-like middle with the outer edges firm.

## Tips

If you can't get fat-free cream cheese, you can use a combination of 500g 2% cottage cheese and 500g low-fat cream cheese.

# BBQ CHICKEN SHEET PAN PIZZA

**Serves:** 8 | **Prep:** 2 HRS | **Cook:** 18 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 430 | 11 | 46 | N/A | 39 |

## Ingredients

### DRY

- 390g all-purpose flour
- 100g vital wheat gluten
- 6g salt
- 7g instant yeast

### WET

- 15g extra virgin olive oil
- 360g water

### PIZZA

- 4g extra virgin olive oil
- Dough
- 220g no sugar added BBQ sauce
- 252g chicken breast, cooked
- 224g fat-free mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 252g part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded
- Cilantro, chopped

## Directions

1. Add all Dry Ingredients in a food processor and process on high for 30 seconds.
2. Add olive oil onto the dry ingredients, put the top on, turn the processor on high, and slowly add water over 15-20 seconds. Continue to process for an additional 30 seconds.
3. Lightly spray a large bowl with oil, plop the dough on the counter, form into a ball, and add to the bowl. Lightly spray the top of the bowl with oil and cover for 90 minutes or until doubled in size.
4. Pour olive oil on sheet pan and spread around the entire sheet pan.
5. Take dough out of the bowl, let it hang for a couple seconds so it naturally starts stretching into a rectangular shape, and plop it onto the sheet pan.
6. Using the tips of your fingers, start stretching the dough out across the pan by pressing outwards. Cover with another sheet pan or a damp towel for 30 minutes.
7. If the corners snapped back a little bit, lightly stretch the dough back into the corners of the pan. Top the dough with BBQ sauce, chicken, fat-free cheese, and part-skim cheese.
8. Bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 16-20 minutes or until cheese begins to brown.
9. Garnish with cilantro, slice, and enjoy.

## Tips

It will not hurt the dough if it rises longer than 90 minutes as it still needs an additional rise anyway. If you need to go somewhere for 2-3 hours, your dough will be ready for you when you get back. TIP: If the dough keeps snapping back when you are stretching it in the sheet pan, cover it and let it rest for 15-20 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax and help the dough to stretch.

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |

1. Lightly sprinkle corn meal onto the work surface, flip dough onto the corn meal and add additional corn meal to the bottom of the dough.
2. Flip the dough back over and using a rolling pin, roll back and forth two times. Turn the dough 90° or a quarter turn, and roll back and forth two more times. Repeat this process until the dough is 10-11".
3. Pick up the dough, make two fists underneath it and move the dough in a circular motion. Make sure you go around the entire dough. The dough should be about 12" now.
4. Take the dough and grab the crust by your finger tips. Similar to spinning the dough with your fists, do the same thing to the crust and go all the way around the pizza. The dough should now have reached final form at 14".
5. Roll out the edges of the dough to remove any air pockets and flatten.
6. Place dough on top of a sheet of parchment paper and add pizza sauce, leaving about a quarter inch for a crust.
7. Add remaining toppings in the order listed and add to a preheated 550°F oven for 8-10 minutes.

## Tips

Keep the au jus if you plan to make another pizza or an italian beef sandwich in the next week. Simply reheat the au jus and beef to 140°F and the italian beef is ready.

# CHICKEN ALFREDO PIZZA

**Serves:** 1 | **Prep:** 1.5 HRS | **Cook:** 1.25 HRS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 903 | 18 | 101 | N/A | 89 |

## Ingredients

- 3 chicken breasts
- 1 head of garlic, roasted

### DOUGH

- 110g King Arthur® bread flour
- 20g vital wheat gluten
- 1.5g yeast
- 1g salt
- 91g water

### PIZZA BUILD

- 14g corn meal
- Dough
- 80g roasted garlic alfredo sauce (45 cal)
- 6g roasted garlic
- 105g chicken, cooked
- 7g Parmigiano Reggiano cheese
- 40g fat-free mozzarella cheese
- 40g part-skim mozzarella cheese

## Directions

1. BRINE your chicken breasts.
2. While the chicken is brining, ROAST your garlic.
3. While the garlic is roasting, add the bread flour, vital wheat gluten, yeast, and salt into a food processor and process on high for 30 seconds.
4. While processor is running, slowly add water over 15-20 seconds. Continue to process for an additional 30 seconds.
5. Lightly spray a medium-sized bowl with oil, plop the dough on the counter, form into a ball, and add to the bowl. Lightly spray the top of the dough with oil and cover for 90 minutes or until doubled in size.
6. Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel and add chicken to a preheated 400°F oven for 20-25 minutes or until internal temperature of the chicken reaches 155°F.
7. Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces.
8. Cover the work surface with corn meal, add the dough on top of the corn meal bottom side down, and cover the top of the dough with corn meal as well.
9. Stretch the dough until it is about 11” in diameter, leaving the crust thicker than the rest of the pizza. Lightly dust a pizza peel with corn meal.
10. Toss the dough back and forth between your hands to remove any excess corn meal and place the dough onto the pizza peel.
11. Top the dough with alfredo sauce, garlic, chicken, Parmigiano Reggiano, and fat-free and part-skim mozzarella.
12. Bake in a preheated oven at the highest temperature possible (mine oven goes to 550°F) for 5-8 minutes or until cheese starts browning
13. Add to a wire rack to cool, slice, and it's time to eat.

## Tips

TIP: Grill the chicken breasts instead for greater flavor. TIP: If you would like slices that don't bend or break, once the pizza has cooled off, I would add the pizza back in the oven for 60-90 seconds. The bottom will become crispy again while holding all the toppings as you eat it.

## Notes

FYI: Only 6 grams of corn meal was used to calculate the macros. During the testing of this recipe, I took the average of how much corn meal was used on the pizza versus what was left over.

13. Bake pizza in a preheated 400°F oven for 30-40 minutes. Once removed from the oven, top with parmesan, slice it, and it is time to eat.

## Tips

I would wait 5-10 minutes before slicing and another 5 minutes before serving to avoid burning your mouth. You have been warned.

6. Cover the dough for 20 minutes, repeat steps 4 and 5, and divide the dough into 2 pieces. Each piece should weigh roughly 275g.
7. Form each piece into individual balls by flattening the dough with your fingers, folding each side of the dough into the middle, flipping it over, and rolling it in a circular motion until a ball is formed.
8. Grab 2 high-sided containers, lightly spray them with oil, and add the dough balls. Cover with a lid and refrigerate for a minimum of 24 hours. (96 hours creates peak flavor)
9. Add olive oil and garlic to a preheated pot on medium heat and mix. Sauté the garlic for 30 seconds, add oregano and basil, and stir to combine.
10. After 10-15 seconds, immediately add all other sauce ingredients and mix.
11. Bring sauce to a simmer, turn the heat down to low, and let it reduce for 15 minutes. Add to a container and refrigerate.
12. Grab an 8x10" hard-anodized pan and spread Crisco® around the bottom and sides of the pan. Add dough to the pan and cover.
13. After 1-2 hours, spread the dough out edge to edge and cover for 2-4 hours
14. Parbake dough in a preheated 500°F oven for 6-8 minutes and get all other toppings ready.
15. Remove pan from oven, add toppings, and bake for another 8-12 minutes.
16. Immediately place the pizza on a wire rack so the bottom stays crispy.

# GARLIC PARMESAN BONELESS WINGS

**Serves:** 3 | **Prep:** 1.75 HRS | **Cook:** 20 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 418 | 11 | 25 | N/A | 56 |

## Ingredients

- 672g chicken breast

### DRY STATION

- 70g all-purpose flour
- 20g corn starch
- 1g chili powder
- 2g paprika
- 2g cumin
- 3g onion powder
- 3g garlic powder
- 3g salt
- 2g black pepper

### WET STATION

- 15g fat-free milk
- 1 egg
- 1 egg white
- Oil spray to coat

## Directions

1. PREP AND BRINE chicken breast, then cut into boneless wing-sized chunks.
2. While chicken is brining, make GARLIC PARMESAN SAUCE.
3. Add Dredging Ingredients to your wet and dry station containers and mix thoroughly.
4. Add a few chunks of meat at a time into flour mixture using one hand, which I call your "dry hand".
5. Using your other hand, or "wet hand," completely cover the coated chicken in wet mixture and let any excess liquid drip off.
6. Finish chicken by adding it back into the flour mixture and push any of the flour mixture into the cracks and crevices of the chicken to make sure it is completely coated. Add to a wire rack.
7. Lightly spray chicken with oil, then add to a preheated 400°F air fryer oil side down. Lightly spray the other side with oil as well.
8. Cook for 6-8 minutes, flipping halfway through. If you see any white spots after flipping, quickly spray with oil and continue cooking.
9. In a medium-sized bowl, add 220g of cooked chicken and 30g of GARLIC PARMESAN SAUCE. Using a brush, coat the pieces of chicken evenly with sauce.
10. Put any additional servings WITHOUT sauce into meal prep containers.
11. When hunger strikes, reheat in air fryer for 3-4 minutes at 350°F, add sauce, and they will be as good as new.

## Tips

TIP: You can reduce prep time by nearly 30 minutes by buying a "Better Breader." This device can essentially bread all of the pieces at once without having to go one by one. This is available in my Amazon store if you want to check it out. TIP: When cooking, try and make sure the pieces of chicken aren't touching each other. If you need to do it in batches, that's okay.

## Directions

1. Add flour, vital wheat gluten, yeast, and salt into a food processor and mix on high for 1 minute.
2. While mixing, add butter one cube at a time and mix for an additional 15 seconds.
3. While mixing, add water over a 20-30 second period and continue blending for an additional 30 seconds.
4. Lightly spray a medium-sized bowl with oil, plop the dough on the counter, form into a ball, and add to the bowl. Cover for 1.5-2 hours.
5. Add all sauce ingredients directly into the crushed tomato can and mix. Add to a container and refrigerate.
6. Add all spices to a small bowl besides the garlic cloves and bay leaf. Add spices to a preheated saucepan on medium heat and mix together. Let dry roast for 30-45 seconds.
7. Add bay leaf, garlic cloves, and beef broth to the saucepan and bring to a simmer.
8. Add beef bouillon and stir. Turn the pot to low and allow it to simmer for 30 minutes.
9. Place a strainer over a medium-sized bowl, pour the au jus through the strainer, and wipe the saucepan with a towel.
10. Discard spices, pour the au jus back into the saucepan, and place back onto the stovetop.
11. Add roast beef to the saucepan and heat the beef juice to 140°F. Remove pan from heat and allow meat to marinade.
12. Place a strainer on top of a plate, add giardiniera and allow to drain for at least 20 minutes.
13. Grab the same bowl used to strain the spices and strain the beef. Allow beef to drain for 20 minutes.

16. Lightly sprinkle corn meal onto the work surface, flip dough onto the corn meal and add additional corn meal to the bottom of the dough.
17. Flip the dough back over and using a rolling pin, roll back and forth two times. Turn the dough 90° or a quarter turn, and roll back and forth two more times. Repeat this process until the dough is 16.1".
18. Pick up the dough, make two fists underneath it and move the dough in a circular motion. Make sure you go around the entire dough. The dough should be about 12" now.
19. Take the dough and grab the crust by your finger tips. Similar to spinning the dough with your fists, do the same thing to the crust and go all the way around the pizza. The dough should now have reached final form at 14".
20. Roll out the edges of the dough to remove any air pockets and flatten.
21. Place dough on top of a sheet of parchment paper and add pizza sauce, leaving about a quarter inch for a crust.
22. Add remaining toppings in the order listed and add to a preheated 550°F oven for 8-10 minutes.
23. Enjoy an authentic Chicago style pizza.

## Tips

Keep the au jus if you plan to make another pizza or an italian beef sandwich in the next week. Simply reheat the au jus and beef to 140°F and the Italian beef is ready.

## Notes

If there is too much oil or au jus on the pizza, it will end up a soggy mess.

2. Turn the processor on high while slowly adding the water over a 30 second period and let dough mixture process for an additional 20-30 seconds.
3. Flip the dough onto work surface, shape it into a ball, and place it in a lightly oiled medium-sized bowl. Spray the top of the dough with oil and cover for 60 minutes.
4. Grate 100g of onion on a box grater and drain any extra liquid.
5. Add olive oil, onion, and garlic to a preheated pot on medium heat, stir to combine, and let them cook for a few minutes while stirring occasionally.
6. Once the ingredients start to take on some color, add tomato paste and incorporate it into the mixture.

13. Bake pizza in a preheated 400°F oven for 30-40 minutes. Once removed from the oven, top with parmesan, slice it, and it is time to eat.

## Tips

I would wait 5-10 minutes before slicing and another 5 minutes before serving to avoid burning your mouth. You have been warned.

- 35g unflavored whey protein powder
- 50g all-purpose flour
- 10g potato starch

### SAUCE

- 6g salt (for ground beef)
- 15g olive oil
- 250g onion, grated
- 3g salt (for onions)
- 2g black pepper
- 25g garlic paste
- 30g Calabrian chilis, chopped
- 45g tomato paste
- 1588g Cento All-in-One Crushed Tomatoes
- 40g water
- 2g salt (for tomatoes)
- 10g fresh basil

### CHEESE FILLING

- 454g whole milk ricotta
- 448g fat-free mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 224g 2% cottage cheese
- 45g Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated
- 284g frozen chopped spinach
- 15g fresh parsley, chopped
- 3g salt
- 3g garlic powder
- 1 egg, beaten

### TOPPING

- 224g part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded

## Directions

1. Flatten ground beef on a sheet pan, season with salt, set oven to broil on high, and place the pan 6 inches from the broiler. Cook 18-22 minutes or until a deep brown crust forms.
2. Add all crepe ingredients to a high-sided container and blend with an immersion blender. A standard blender works too.
3. Microwave spinach 3-4 minutes, then squeeze out excess water using a cheesecloth or paper towels.
4. Combine all cheese filling ingredients in a large bowl, mix well, and set aside.
5. Grate the onion, prep the remaining sauce ingredients, and place everything next to a preheated pot over medium heat.
6. Add grated onion to the pot. Let the excess liquid steam off, then drizzle in the olive oil and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to take on color.
7. While the onions sauté, use a meat chopper to crumble the broiled ground beef into small pieces.
8. Stir the salt, black pepper, garlic paste, Calabrian chilis, and tomato paste into the onions and cook for 2-3 minutes.
9. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, then fill each empty can with 20g of water. Shake the water around the inside of the cans to loosen the remaining tomato and pour that liquid into the pot.
10. Throw the ground beef into the pot, mix, bring the sauce to a simmer, and reduce for 30 minutes, or until a spatula leaves a clear trail in the pan.
11. While the sauce simmers, stir the crepe batter to lift any starch from the bottom of the container. Lightly spray a preheated pan (8-inch surface) over medium-low heat with oil, pour in 62g of batter, and quickly spread it across the surface before it sets.
12. Cook 2-3 minutes or until the crepe loosens when you shake the pan. Flip, cook 10-15 seconds, and transfer to a plate.
13. Repeat until you have 12 crepes. Stir basil into the sauce and remove from heat.
14. Spread a thick 1-inch layer of sauce across the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
15. For each crepe, shape 110g of cheese filling into a 5-inch log and place it on the lower third. Roll the crepe like a burrito with the ends tucked in and place seam-side down in the dish. Make two rows of six crepes.
16. Cover the manicotti with a layer of sauce and top with mozzarella. You should still have about 420g of sauce leftover. Cover with parchment paper, then aluminum foil.
17. Bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 20-32 minutes. Remove the parchment/foil, then bake another 12-15 minutes.
18. Broil for the final 2 minutes or until the cheese browns, keeping the dish 6 inches from the broiler.
19. Plate each manicotti with some of the surrounding sauce from the dish, plus 35g of the leftover sauce.

## Tips

To reheat from the fridge, cover with a damp paper towel and microwave 1:30-2:30. Rest 1 minute, then microwave another 20-30 seconds. To reheat from frozen, microwave at 40% power for 6-8 minutes, rest 1 minute, then microwave at 70% power for 1-2 minutes.

## Tips

You can use store bought baguettes if you would like, but the protein baguette recipe makes 8 servings that you can store in the freezer for months and is well worth making in my opinion.

# NICKCHICKEN

**Serves:** 5 | **Prep:** 1 HR | **Cook:** 20 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 388 | 9 | 38 | N/A | 37 |

## Ingredients

### CHICKEN MIX

- 700g chicken breast
- 9g salt
- 6g granulated erythritol

### WET STATION 1

- 230g water
- 20g corn starch

### DRY STATION

- 90g all-purpose flour
- 3g garlic powder
- 3g paprika
- 3g salt
- 2g white pepper
- 3g black pepper

### WET STATION 2

- 1 egg
- 1 egg white
- 2g baking powder

### FINISHING TOUCHES

- Olive oil spray

### NICKCHICKEN BUILD

- Buns (110 Cal)
- 1 NickChicken patty
- 15g light mayonnaise
- Lettuce

## Directions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 400°F.
2. Cut chicken breast into medium-sized chunks, add to blender, and pulse blender for 10-15 seconds or until it is a similar consistency to ground chicken.
3. Add ground chicken to a bowl, then add salt and erythritol. Mix together until ingredients are thoroughly combined.
4. Spray your hands with oil so the ground chicken does not stick to your hands, then separate the chicken mix into 140g-sized balls. Form the chicken balls into patties that are slightly wider than the buns, and place on a piece of parchment paper.
5. Set up dredging stations by adding all Dredge Station Ingredients to three separate containers and mixing until well combined.
6. With one hand or your "wet hand," take a chicken patty, submerge it into the first wet station container, let extra liquid drip off, and place into the dry ingredients container.
7. Using your other hand or what I like to call your "dry hand," add the wet patty to your dry flour mixture and push flour into the patty to coat it thoroughly, making sure the sides of the patty are covered as well.
8. Once patty is fully coated, shake any excess flour off, and add to wet station two.
9. Make sure the chicken patty is completely coated in egg wash and let any excess drip off.
10. Put chicken patty back into the dry station and repeat step 7.
11. Place the finished chicken patty on wire rack, mix wet station one with whisk, and repeat the process until all patties are breaded.
12. Spray the bottom of the air fryer with oil and place a patty into the air fryer basket, and lightly spray the top of the patty.
13. Cook chicken for 6-8 minutes in the air fryer, or until chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165°F, flipping halfway through. Repeat this process until all chicken is cooked.
14. When ready to eat, toast inside of the buns and chop lettuce.
15. Add NickChicken to bottom bun, then some chopped lettuce. Add mayo to the top bun and complete the NickChicken by closing the sandwich.
16. Put any extra NickChicken's in separate containers and reheat whenever hunger arises.
17. I typically reheat these in a preheated 350°F air fryer for 4 minutes.

## Tips

Put some of the dry mix on a plate or in a separate container before patting patty into the dry station. Then you can easily add the dry mixture to the top of the patty after it is already in the dry station container. For best results, use an air fryer when possible. However, you can use a preheated 400°F oven for 20 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken patty reaches 155°F. I recommend using a food thermometer to check the internal temperature of the chicken and make sure it reaches 155°F before removing from air fryer. There will be carryover cooking of another 5 degrees or so while it is sitting.

If you have a range hood or another way to ventilate your kitchen, I would utilize it. There will be a lot of smoke from the charring of the ground beef that is necessary to get that authentic smash burger taste. If you don't have a range hood, opening windows with a fan pointing towards the window would also be a great way to mitigate the smoke.

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, combine all fajita seasoning ingredients. Set aside.

# STEAK TACOS

**Serves:** 5-8 | **Prep:** 4.5 HRS | **Cook:** 10 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 438 | 19 | 25 | N/A | 39 |

## Ingredients

- 2-3lb skirt steak
- Corn tortillas (35-40 cal)

### MARINADE

- 4g garlic, minced
- 5g Tajin® original
- 2g habanero powder
- 2g black pepper
- 30g soy sauce
- 20g avocado oil
- 5g salt

### TOPPINGS

- 60g onion, chopped
- 10g fresh cilantro, chopped
- 14g oaxaca cheese, shredded

### ONE SERVING

- 3 tortillas
- 126g cooked skirt steak
- 14g oaxaca cheese, shredded
- Cilantro and onion, to taste

## Directions

1. Trim any excess fat from the skirt steak and tenderize using pointed teeth side of tenderizer.
2. Place steak in a gallon zipper bag and add all of the Marinade Ingredients to the bag.
3. Close bag and shake to cover the steak thoroughly in marinade. Making sure every crevice of the steak has marinade on it is important for even flavor.
4. Place the bag in the fridge for a minimum of 4 hours and up to 24. More time = more flavor.
5. Turn grill to high and let it preheat for 15 minutes.
6. Cook steaks on the grill, 2-3 minutes per side.
7. Wrap steak in aluminum foil and let sit on the counter for 15-30 minutes.
8. Dice an onion, chop cilantro, and shred cheese for taco topping.
9. Cut steak against the grain into bite-sized pieces.
10. Weigh out 126g of cooked steak, heat up 3 tortillas, add Toppings, and enjoy!

## Tips

When getting your steak from the store ask the deli to cut the fat off for you. This will save you time. You can also do this in a pan, but there will be a ton of smoke. If your kitchen doesn’t have a vent hood, you are guaranteed to set off fire alarms. I would suggest opening a couple of windows and facing a fan towards the window to ventilate the smoke.

# MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 456 | 16 | 49 | 29 | 50 |

## Ingredients

### MELTING CHOCOLATE

- 113g semi-sweet chocolate bar
- 7g peanut oil

### WET

- 430g 1% milk
- 4.2g vanilla extract
- Peppermint extract (See tip below!)
- 8 drops green food coloring (not necessary)

### DRY

- 32.4 Gorilla Mode Vanilla Ice Cream protein
- 20g granulated erythritol
- .5g salt
- .5g xanthan gum

### MIX-INS

- 28g melting chocolate

## Directions

1. Melt chocolate using the double boiler method.
2. Fill a small pot with 1" of water and bring to a simmer. Place a ceramic bowl over the pot, making sure the bowl is wider than the pot. Add chocolate.
3. Once melted, add oil and mix with a whisk until combined.
4. Line a quarter sheet pan or small tray with parchment paper.
5. Add the melted chocolate to the sheet pan and spread into a thin layer. Freeze until solid.
6. Add chocolate to a cutting board and chop into bite sized pieces. Add chocolate to a plastic bag and freeze. This makes enough chocolate for 4 pints.
7. Add Wet Ingredients into a high-sided container.
8. In a measuring cup, add Dry Ingredients and whisk together.
9. Put an immersion blender in the bottom of the container and start blending the Wet Ingredients together. Slowly add your Dry Ingredients into the container.
10. Once all Dry Ingredients have dissolved, continue blending for 90 seconds.
11. Add the liquid to a pint, put the top on, and freeze for 24 hours.
12. Take the frozen pint, run it under hot water for 60 seconds, load it into the CREAMI®, and hit the sorbet button.
13. Using a butter knife, make a hole in the middle of the pint about 1" in diameter, pull the ice cream out, and load the chocolate into the center.
14. Don't pull the chocolate out of the freezer until you need to fill the center. The chocolate melts very quickly at room temperature.
15. Place the previously removed ice cream into the pint, reload the pint, and press the mix-in setting.

## Tips

Peppermint extract strength and flavor is going to vary brand to brand. The two I experimented with are Loranns Oils® and McCormick's®. They both taste great in mint ice cream, but have their differences. McCormick's® is a more laid back mint flavor while LorAnn's® is more intense. If using McCormick's®, use 12 drops. If using LorAnn's®, use 4 drops.

## Ingredients

- 1120g chicken breast
- 60g all-purpose flour
- 1 egg
- 140g Italian-style breadcrumbs
- 235g Frank's RedHot® sauce

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. Cut chicken breasts into 1-2" thick strips.
3. Set up dredging station with 3 containers. Meal prep containers work best in this instance.
4. Put flour in first container, an egg in the second, and breadcrumbs in the third.
5. Beat egg with a whisk until smooth.
6. Lay one strip at a time in the flour and thoroughly cover. Make sure to get flour into all of the crevices of the chicken to ensure full coverage.
7. Put the chicken strip in the egg wash, making sure it is thoroughly coated. Let excess egg wash drip off of the chicken before transferring to the breadcrumb station.
8. Lay the chicken on top of the breadcrumbs, pick up the container and start shaking it back and forth to fully coat the chicken strip.

## Tips

Bake your chicken strips in an air fryer at 400°F for 6-8 minutes to cook your tenders faster and make them crispier. Use a sauce brush to coat the tenders with hot sauce for a more even coat and no risk of the breading coming off.

7. Take the other slice of bread and place the toasted side onto the cheese mixture. Once the bottom slice of bread is toasted, flip over to toast the other side.
8. Once finished, put in microwave for 15-20 seconds or until cheese starts melting down the sides. Due to thickness of this grilled cheese, if you want a truly melty consistency this step is an absolute must.

## Tips

If bread is too soft after the microwave, put back on the pan for 1-2 minutes per side to crisp back up.

**Serves:** 5 | **Prep:** 20 MINS | **Cook:** 3 HRS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 506 | 14 | 68 | N/A | 34 |

## Ingredients

### BURRITO BUILD (X5)

- 9" tortilla (200 cal)
- 160g refried beans
- 30g fat-free cheddar cheese, shredded
- 30g 2% sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
- Oil spray

## Directions

1. Make REFRIED BEANS. A pinch of smoked paprika was added to the beans for this recipe. Your final beans should be much thicccer than if you were eating them as a side dish, so they hold up better in the burrito.
2. Once beans have cooled, add beans and cheese to the middle of each tortilla. Wrap into burritos.
3. Lightly spray a preheated pan or griddle on medium heat with oil and add each burrito folded side down. Lightly press down on each burrito to ensure even browning and to help them seal.

# $1 NEAPOLITAN PIZZA

**Serves:** 5 | **Prep:** 24 HR | **Cook:** 10 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 608 | 12 | 84 | N/A | 37 |

## Ingredients

### DRY

- 475g all-purpose flour
- 100g vital wheat gluten
- 12.5g salt
- 4g instant yeast

### WET

- 425g water

### TOPPINGS

- 300g fresh mozzarella
- 350g 6 in 1 ground tomatoes

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, whisk the dry ingredients together. Add water and mix with a spoon until a shaggy dough forms.
2. Use a wet hand to press and fold the dough until fully combined and no dry parts remain. Cover and rest for 20 minutes.
3. With a wet hand, pull one side of the dough up as high as possible and fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl 90°, repeating 3-4 times. Flip the dough, form a ball, and cover for another 20 minutes.
4. Repeat step 3.
5. Divide the dough into 5 pieces, each about 200g.
6. Flatten each piece, fold the edges into the center, flip, and shape into a ball by pulling it toward yourself. Rotate 90° and repeat until smooth.
7. Place each dough ball in a vacuum-sealed bag and refrigerate for 24 hours.
8. After refrigeration, re-seal each bag to remove any air caused by the yeast, then freeze.
9. Portion five servings of 60g cheese, pat dry with a paper towel, and vacuum seal with slight separation between pieces. Divide sauce into five 70g portions and transfer to containers. Freeze both.
10. 2-3 hours before baking, place a dough ball, sauce, and cheese on the counter to defrost. Transfer the cheese to a small bowl to manage condensation.
11. Lightly flour your surface and carefully remove the dough from the vac seal. Place it on the floured surface and dust the top with flour.
12. Outline the crust with your fingers. Press outward from the center of the dough until it is about 6 inches wide. If sticking occurs, add more flour and continue stretching.
13. Lift the dough (avoiding the crust) and stretch it with your fists in a circular motion until 9-11 inches wide.
14. Place the stretched dough on parchment paper and top with tomatoes.
15. Bake on a preheated pizza steel at 550°F for 4-5 minutes. Remove, pat mozzarella dry with paper towel, and add to the pizza. Bake for an additional 2-3 minutes.

## Tips

You can use regular freezer bags to store the dough. Just keep in mind, it will get freezer burn and lose flavor faster.

# $1 PAN PIZZA

**Serves:** 5 | **Prep:** 1 HR | **Cook:** 13 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 651 | 14 | 91 | N/A | 40 |

## Ingredients

### DOUGH

- 500g all-purpose flour
- 100g vital wheat gluten
- 10g salt
- 5g instant yeast
- 440g water

### SAUCE

- 28oz can Cento® crushed tomatoes
- 1.5g garlic powder
- 6g salt, or to taste

### PIZZA BUILD

- Oil spray
- 1 Dough
- 80g Sauce
- 60g part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded

## Directions

1. Place flour, vital wheat gluten, yeast, and salt into a food processor and process for 30 seconds.
2. Turn processor on high, slowly mix in water over a 30-60 second period, and let dough mixture process for an additional 30-60 seconds.
3. Plop dough onto the counter, roll it into a ball, and divide the dough into 5 pieces. Each piece should weigh roughly 200-210g.
4. Form each dough into individual balls by flattening the dough with your fingers, folding each side of the dough into the middle, flipping it over, and rolling it in a circular motion until a ball is formed.
5. Grab 5 high sided containers, lightly spray oil into each one, put one dough ball into each container, spray the top of the dough ball, cover with a lid, and put any dough that will not be used in the next hour or two in the fridge.
6. In a separate high-sided container, add the can of tomatoes, garlic powder, and salt. Stir to combine, cover with a lid, and refrigerate.
7. Spray oil onto your hands and an oven safe pan, plop dough into the middle, start stretching it towards the corners of the pan, and spread it to your desired size and thickness. If the dough keeps snapping back, cover it for 15 minutes, then come back and finish stretching. This gives the dough time to relax.
8. Add sauce and spread evenly over the dough with the back of a spoon. Top with mozzarella cheese and bake in a preheated 425°F oven for 12-14 minutes or until cheese is golden brown.
9. Using a spatula, check the bottom of the pizza to make sure it is golden brown as well. If it isn't, you can put it on the stovetop on medium heat and check it every minute or two until it is cooked to your preference.

## Tips

Dough can be stored in the fridge up to a week and actually develops MORE flavor over time. You can store any unused dough by spreading it out in a lightly oiled gallon bag, freezing it, and removing it about an hour before they need to be used.

## Ingredients

### INGREDIENTS

- 3 chicken breasts
- 1 head of garlic, roasted
- 110g King Arthur® bread flour
- 20g vital wheat gluten
- 1.5g salt
- 1g yeast
- 91g water

### PIZZA BUILD

- 14g corn meal
- Dough
- 80g roasted garlic alfredo sauce (45 cal)
- 6g roasted garlic
- 105g chicken, cooked
- 7g Parmigiano Reggiano cheese
- 40g fat-free mozzarella cheese
- 40g part-skim mozzarella cheese

## Directions

1. BRINE your chicken breasts.
2. While the chicken is brining, ROAST your garlic.
3. While the garlic is roasting, add the bread flour, vital wheat gluten, yeast, and salt into a food processor and process on high for 30 seconds.
4. While processor is running, slowly add water over 15-20 seconds. Continue to process for an additional 30 seconds.
5. Lightly spray a medium-sized bowl with oil, plop the dough on the counter, form into a ball, and add to the bowl. Lightly spray the top of the dough with oil and cover for 90 minutes or until doubled in size.
6. Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel and add chicken to a preheated 400°F oven for 20-25 minutes or until internal temperature of the chicken reaches 155°F. Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces.
7. Cover the work surface with corn meal, add the dough on top of the corn meal bottom side down, and cover the top of the corn meal with corn meal as well.
8. Stretch the dough until it is about 11” in diameter, leaving the crust thicker than the rest of the pizza. Lightly dust a pizza peel with corn meal.
9. Toss the dough back and forth between your hands to remove any excess corn meal and place the dough onto the pizza peel.
10. Top the dough with alfredo sauce, garlic, chicken, Parmigiano Reggiano, and fat-free and part-skim mozzarella.
11. Bake in a preheated oven at the highest temperature possible (mine oven goes to 550°F) for 5-8 minutes or until cheese starts browning
12. Add to a wire rack to cool, slice, and it’s time to eat.

## Tips

Grill the chicken breasts instead for greater flavor. If you would like slices that don't bend or break, once the pizza has cooled off, I would add the pizza back in the oven for 60-90 seconds. The bottom will become crispy again while holding all the toppings as you eat it.

## Notes

FYI: Only 8 grams of corn meal was used to calculate the macros. During the testing of this recipe, I took the average of how much corn meal was used on the pizza versus what was left over.

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 541 | 11 | 72 | N/A | 41 |

## Ingredients

### CHICKEN MIX

- 700g chicken breast
- 9g salt
- 6g granulated erythritol

### WET STATION ONE

- 230g water
- 20g corn starch

### DRY STATION

- 90g all-purpose flour
- 3g garlic powder
- 3g paprika
- 3g salt
- 2g white pepper
- 3g black pepper

### WET STATION TWO

- 1 egg
- 1 egg white
- 2g baking powder

### FINISHING TOUCHES

- Olive oil spray

### NICKCHICKEN BUILD

- Buns (110 Cal)
- 1 NickChicken patty
- 15g light mayonnaise
- Lettuce

### FRENCH FRIES

- 1000g russet potatoes, peeled (about 1200g before peeling)
- 1200g beef broth
- 30g sugar
- 8g oil spray
- Salt, to taste

## Directions

1. Add beef broth and sugar to a large bowl and whisk until sugar is dissolved.
2. Peel potatoes and using a fry tower cutter, cut the potatoes into shoestring french fry size and add to beef broth mixture. Can also cut the fries by hand into 3/8" x 3/8" pieces to replicate the slim profile of a NickDonald's french fry.
3. Once all fries are added to the beef broth, mix fries around to keep them separated. Make sure all fries are covered with broth and set to the side.
4. Preheat an air fryer to 400°F.
5. Cut chicken breast into medium-sized chunks, add to blender, and pulse blender for 10-15 seconds or until it is a similar consistency to ground chicken.
6. Add ground chicken to a bowl, then add salt and erythritol. Mix together until ingredients are thoroughly combined.
7. Spray your hands with oil to prevent the ground chicken from sticking to your hands, then separate the chicken mix into 140g sized balls. Form the chicken balls into patties that are slightly wider than the buns and place on a piece of parchment paper.
8. Set up dredging stations by adding all ingredients to three separate containers and mixing until well combined.
9. With one hand or your "wet hand," take a chicken patty, submerge it into the first wet station container, let extra liquid drip off, and place into the Dry Ingredients container.
10. Using your other hand or what I like to call your "dry hand," add the wet patty to your dry flour mixture and push flour into the patty to coat it thoroughly, making sure the sides of the patty are covered as well.
11. Once patty is fully coated, shake any excess flour off, and add to Wet Station Two.
12. Make sure the chicken patty is completely coated in egg wash and let any excess drip off.
13. Put chicken patty back into the dry station and repeat step 10.
14. Place the finished chicken patty on wire rack and repeat.
15. Spray the bottom of the air fryer and place a patty into the air fryer basket, spraying a light coat of oil on the top of the patty.
16. Cook chicken for 6-8 minutes in the air fryer or until chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165°F, flipping halfway through.
17. Repeat until all chicken is cooked.
18. While patties are cooking, drain broth out of the fries, and add fries to a salad spinner.
19. Use salad spinner to get excess liquid off the fries and place them onto paper towels. If you don't have a salad spinner, paper towels will work by themselves, but you will just have to use more of them.
20. Using paper towels, pat the fries dry and once the final NickChicken is finished, lightly spray the bottom of the air fryer with oil.
21. Add a layer of fries to the air fryer, lightly spray the top of the fries with oil, and repeat layering/oil combination until all fries are added.
22. Cook at 400°F for 20-25 minutes, tossing every 5-6 minutes. Every time the fries are shaken or tossed, lightly spray them with oil.
23. Take fries out, add salt to taste, and shake them to evenly disperse salt.
24. Thinly slice lettuce, add light mayo to condiment cups, lay out 5 meal prep containers, and let NickChickens and fries come to room temperature.
25. Add NickChicken, fries, lettuce, and mayo to each meal prep container and refrigerate.
26. When ready to chow down, toast the inside of a bun, place fries and NickChicken in a preheated 350°F air fryer for 3-4 minutes, plate it, and eat.

## Tips

Put some of the dry mix on a plate or in a separate container before putting patty into the dry station. Then you can easily add the dry mixture to the top of the patty after it is already in the dry station container.

5. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and repeat 3-4 more times until all dough has been stretched.
6. Flip the dough over and form into a ball by sliding your hand underneath the dough and pulling it in a circular motion towards your body.
7. Cover the dough for 20 minutes and repeat steps 4-6. Cover for an additional 20 minutes.
8. Divide the dough into 5 pieces. Each piece should weigh roughly 130g.
9. Form each piece into individual balls by flattening the dough with your fingers, folding each side of the dough into the middle, flipping it over, and rolling it in a circular motion until a ball is formed.
10. Grab 5 high-sided containers, lightly spray oil into each one, put a dough ball into each container, cover with a lid, and refrigerate for 24 hours.
11. Add olive oil and onion to a preheated pot on medium heat and mix. Sauté onion for 2-3 minutes, add garlic and oregano, and stir.
12. Once garlic becomes fragrant, add tomatoes and salt. Stir to combine. When the sauce starts bubbling or boiling, reduce the heat to low, give the pot a mix, and simmer for 15-20 minutes.
13. After cooling, transfer the sauce to a high-sided container and refrigerate.
14. Grab a ceramic bowl that is about 6" wide and 1.5" deep. Lightly spray with oil.
15. Add slices of mozzarella to the bowl, followed by the fat-free mozzarella and sauce.
16. Grab the outside of the dough and rotate it in a circle, letting gravity stretch it out until it is big enough to cover the entire bowl.
17. Lay the dough over the top of the bowl and pat the edges of the dough.

- 1.5g sage
- 1.5g rosemary
- 1g garlic powder
- 1g onion powder

### SANDWICH (1 SERVING)

- 1 English muffin (100 cal)
- 1 slice Velveeta® cheese
- 1 egg
- 1 sausage patty

## Directions

1. Combine sausage ingredients in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 12-24 hours for best flavor.
2. Divide sausage into 80g portions, roll into balls, and place each on a sheet of parchment paper. Cover with another sheet, and press into 5" patties using a flat-bottomed pan or pot.
3. Heat a pan over medium heat and cook the patties for 2-3 minutes on one side, until browned.
4. Flip the patties and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.
5. Wipe the pan clean. Spray six CANNING LIDS AND BANDS with oil for easy release, and place them in the pan.
6. Crack an egg into each, break the yolk, top with salt, and add 30g water to the pan. Cover immediately and cook 2-3 minutes.
7. Let the sausage and eggs cool completely, then pat dry with a paper towel to prevent soggy sandwiches.
8. Assemble the sandwiches by layering the bottom bun, cheese, an egg, a sausage patty, and the top bun. Optional: Toast muffins in the pan before assembling if desired. However, I find with condensation when reheating, it's not worth the extra step.
9. Storage: Freezing: Freeze assembled sandwiches on a sheet pan for 2 hours, then vacuum seal or store in airtight bags. Refrigerating: Wrap sandwiches in parchment paper and refrigerate.
10. Reheating: From frozen: Wrap in parchment paper, thaw overnight in the fridge (10-12 hours), then microwave 60-90 seconds. From fridge: Microwave 60-90 seconds.

## Tips

If you can't get 90% lean ground pork, use ground beef or turkey with similar macros.

3. Dump the contents of the bowl onto the counter and use hands to incorporate until there are no more dry parts left in the dough.
4. Finish "kneading" this dough by squeezing dough for 30-60 seconds, switching hands with each squeeze.
5. Divide dough in half, form into balls, cover with a damp towel or wrap each ball individually with plastic wrap, and rest dough for 30 minutes.
6. Dust counter with flour, plop a dough ball down, dust top of the dough with flour, and roll out using a rolling pin. If dough starts sticking to the rolling pin, add more flour where it is sticking, spread, and continue. I like to roll the dough 4-5 times then turn it 90 degrees, roll 4-5 times again, and repeat.
7. Once rolled out to 11-12", place underneath a damp tea towel or kitchen towel to prevent the tortilla from drying out.
8. Repeat with the second tortilla and place on a preheated cast iron or griddle on medium-high heat.
9. Cook each side for 30-60 seconds, flip, and cook another 30-60 seconds.
10. Put under a separate wet tea towel or kitchen towel until cool.
11. Use right away or fold and place in a plastic bag for up to 3-4 days.

## Tips

If storing for later use, put tortilla in the microwave for 10 seconds when ready to eat. If making a large batch and need to avoid molding, fold twice, place in a gallon bag, and throw into the freezer. When ready to use cover with a damp tea towel or paper towel and reheat for 30 seconds.

## Notes

I include an extra 8g into the macros of all-purpose flour that is used to roll the tortilla out, even though it is not included in the ingredient list itself.

# SAUSAGE EGG NICKMUFFIN

**Serves:** 6 | **Prep:** 15 MINS | **Cook:** 15 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 346 | 15 | 34 | 23 | 29 |

## Ingredients

### SAUSAGE

- 448g 90% lean ground pork
- 6g salt
- 2g MSG
- 2g black pepper
- 1.5g sage
- 1.5g rosemary
- 1g garlic powder
- 1g onion powder
- .5g nutmeg
- 2.5g potato starch
- 20g erythritol

### SANDWICH (1 SERVING)

- 1 English muffin (100 cal)
- 1 slice Velveeta® cheese
- 1 egg
- 1 sausage patty

## Directions

1. Combine sausage ingredients in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 12-24 hours for best flavor.
2. Divide sausage into 80g portions, roll into balls, and place each on a sheet of parchment paper. Cover with another sheet, and press into 5" patties using a flat-bottomed pan or pot.
3. Heat a pan over medium heat and cook the patties for 2-3 minutes on one side, until browned.
4. Flip the patties and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.
5. Wipe the pan clean. Spray six CANNING LIDS AND BANDS with oil for easy release, and place them in the pan.
6. Crack an egg into each, break the yolk, top with salt, and add 30g water to the pan. Cover immediately and cook 2-3 minutes.
7. Let the sausage and eggs cool completely, then pat dry with a paper towel to prevent soggy sandwiches.
8. Assemble the sandwiches by layering the bottom bun, cheese, an egg, a sausage patty, and the top bun. Optional: Toast muffins in the pan before assembling if desired. However, I find with condensation when reheating, it's not worth the extra step.
9. Storage: Freezing: Freeze assembled sandwiches on a sheet pan for 2 hours, then vacuum seal or store in airtight bags. Refrigerating: Wrap sandwiches in parchment paper and refrigerate.
10. Reheating: From frozen: Wrap in parchment paper, thaw overnight in the fridge (10-12 hours), then microwave 60-90 seconds. From fridge: Microwave 60-90 seconds.

## Tips

If you can't get 90% lean ground pork, use ground beef or turkey with similar macros.

# BLT DIP

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|

## Ingredients

- 108g center cut bacon (1 package), chopped
- 450g 0% greek yogurt
- 100g low-fat cream cheese
- 150g tomatoes, chopped

## Directions

1. Let the cream cheese sit at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours before starting this recipe. This will make it MUCH easier to mix into the dip.
2. Arrange the bacon strips evenly on a sheet pan and place in a preheated 450°F oven for 10-14 minutes, or until they reach your preferred level of crispiness.
3. Slice the tomato in half, remove the seeds with a spoon, and then dice the tomato into small, uniform pieces.
4. Add tomato, cream cheese, and greek yogurt to a bowl.
5. Place the cooked bacon on a cutting board, chop into bite-sized pieces, and add to the bowl.
6. Mix all the ingredients together to combine.
7. Enjoy right away or place in the fridge and allow to sit for 24 hours for maximum flavor.

## Tips

I prefer to spend the extra couple minutes cooking fresh bacon to my preferred doneness. However, when short on time, real bacon bits are a great alternative.

# BUFFALO CHICKEN DIP

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 546 | 18 | 16 | N/A | 82 |

## Ingredients

### DIP

- 1 rotisserie chicken, meat only
- 224g fat-free cream cheese
- 170g 2% greek yogurt
- 224g 2% cottage cheese
- 210g Frank's® buffalo sauce
- 2g onion powder
- 2g garlic powder
- 1g dried parsley
- 0.5g dried dill
- 84g 2% cheddar, shredded
- 84g fat-free cheddar, shredded
- 25g green onion, sliced
- 5 pepperoncinis, sliced

### TOPPING

- 42g pork rinds
- 14g Parmigiano-Reggiano
- 10g buffalo sauce
- 17.5g light ranch
- 4.5g green onion, diced

## Directions

1. Let the cream cheese sit at room temp for 1-2 hours until softened.
2. Remove the meat from the chicken, add it to a bowl, and shred it into bite-sized chunks.
3. Mix in the softened cream cheese.
4. Into a high-sided container, combine Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, 30g buffalo sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, parsley, and dill. Blend with an immersion blender until smooth.
5. Pour the blended mixture into the bowl along with the remaining buffalo sauce, cheddar cheese, chopped green onion (use the white/lighter parts), and pepperoncinis. Mix everything well.
6. Spread evenly into an 8"x8" pan.
7. Using a blender cup, mix pork rinds until a crumb-like texture forms. Combine with parmesan, then sprinkle over the top.
8. Bake in a preheated 375°F oven for 25-30 minutes.
9. Finish with buffalo sauce, ranch, and more green onion (the green part).
10. Slice into 4 squares, dig in, and watch the muscle pile on.

## Tips

During my five rotisserie chicken tests, I averaged 360g breast meat, 150g thigh meat, 73g drumstick meat, and 43g wing meat. I used these numbers to calculate the final calories and macros for this dish. For the best accuracy, place the bowl on a scale during step 2 and measure the amount of meat you get from each section. You can use 626g canned chicken here, but it'll bring the flavor down 3-4 notches (aka significantly). If you can't get fat-free cream cheese, replace with an additional 224g 2% cottage cheese.

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 218 | 4 | 43 | N/A | 5 |

## Ingredients

- 2000g water
- 30g salt
- 6g baking soda
- 1200g Yukon gold potatoes
- 20g olive oil
- 8g garlic, minced
- 2g fresh oregano, chopped
- 2g salt
- 1g black pepper
- 3g fresh parsley, chopped

## Directions

1. Place a sheet pan in the oven and preheat to 450°F.
2. In a large pot, add water, salt, and baking soda, stirring until dissolved. Place on the stovetop over high heat.
3. Set a small pan on medium heat next to the pot.
4. Cut each potato into 4-6 pieces depending on size. Each piece should be around 2-3".
5. Add potatoes to the boiling pot, stir, and boil for 10 minutes.
6. While the potatoes boil, add oil and oregano to the small pan. After 30-60 seconds, add the garlic and a pinch of salt, and stir.
7. Once the garlic turns golden brown, strain the oil over a large bowl and set the strainer aside.
8. Using a colander, strain the potatoes and let them steam for 4-5 minutes.
9. Add potatoes to the bowl of oil, season with salt and pepper, and toss to combine.
10. Be a bit rough with the potatoes. They should look slightly battered, which will help create an amazingly crispy crust.
11. Carefully remove the sheet pan from oven, pour the potatoes onto it, and spread them out evenly. Ensure the flesh of the potato, not the skin, is touching the pan.
12. Throw the potatoes in the oven for 25-30 minutes.
13. Carefully flip the potatoes so that another part of the flesh is touching the sheet pan. Return to the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until deeply golden brown.
14. Transfer the finished potatoes to a bowl, add the fried garlic and oregano, and toss. Top with parsley and salt to taste.
15. Take a bite and listen to the unbelievable crunch. Each serving should weigh about 115 grams.
16. To reheat, simply add them to a preheated 400°F air fryer for 3-4 minutes.

# MAC AND CHEESE EGG ROLLS

**Serves:** 4 | **Prep:** 1.5 HRS | **Cook:** 30 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 271 | 3 | 42 | N/A | 21 |

## Ingredients

- 126g Banza® Noodles
- 4g salt
- Dash onion powder
- Dash black pepper

### CHEESE MIX

- 4 slices fat-free American cheese
- 2 slices sharp cheddar Velveeta®
- 56g fat-free cheddar cheese
- 60g fat-free milk
- 4g garlic, minced

### EGG ROLL BUILD

- 4 egg roll wraps (80 cal per wrap)
- 1 egg white
- Oil spray (4 seconds total)

## Directions

1. Add noodles and salt to boiling water and cook per label instructions, stirring occasionally so noodles do not stick to the bottom of the pot.
2. Drain noodles and save some of the pasta water for later.
3. Add noodles back to pot, put pot back on stovetop, and set burner to low.
4. Add all Cheese Mix ingredients and stir to combine. If necessary, add a spoonful or two of pasta water to successfully melt everything together. The goal is to have a thick mac and cheese so that the egg rolls fry up perfectly in the air fryer without leaking.
5. Separate egg white from the egg yolk into a small bowl and whisk until smooth.
6. Put 4 egg roll wraps on counter and using a brush, spread egg white on outer edges of the wrap. Add mac and cheese as evenly as possible across the center of each wrap.
7. Take the corner of the egg roll and wrap it over the mac and cheese. Try and tuck the triangle portion of the wrap into/under the mac and cheese.
8. Add more egg white to the corners of the wrap and fold in.
9. Add a little more egg white to the tip of the wrap and finish rolling. Make sure egg roll is fully sealed and repeat.
10. Place egg rolls on lightly oiled parchment paper and freeze for one hour. You can cook these right away, but I have found it to be better after freezing.
11. Add egg white to the entire outside of egg rolls, then add to a preheated 400°F air fryer fold side down and spray the top with oil for one second per egg roll.
12. After 3 minutes, flip egg rolls and spray each one with oil for an additional second.
13. Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, get some low-calorie ranch and ENJOY.

## Tips

Make double the egg rolls, pull them from the freezer, and air fry whenever you need a quick snack or meal. Use these as an appetizer or as a side to another low-calorie entrée.

## Ingredients

- 1000g russet potatoes, peeled (about ~1200g before peeling)
- 1200g beef broth
- 30g sugar
- 8g oil spray
- Salt, to taste

## Directions

1. Add beef broth and sugar into a large bowl and whisk to combine.
2. Peel potatoes and, using a fry tower cutter, cut the potatoes into shoestring french fry size and add to beef broth mixture.  Can also cut the fries by hand into c" x c" pieces to replicate the slim profile of a NickDonalds french fry.
3. Once all fries are added to the beef broth, mix fries around to keep them separated. Make sure all fries are covered with broth and let them marinade for 30 minutes.
4. Drain liquid out of bowl and dry the fries using a salad spinner and/or paper towels.
5. Add a layer of fries to a preheated 400°F air fryer, lightly spray the top of the fries with oil, and repeat layering/oil combination until all fries are added.
6. Cook for 20-25 minutes; tossing every 5-6 minutes.  Every time the fries are shaken or tossed, lightly spray them with oil.
7. Take fries out, add salt to taste, and shake them to evenly disperse salt.
8. Split into 5 portions and store them for use as a side dish to other meals throughout the week.
9. To reheat, simply add them to a preheated 400°F air fryer for 3-4 minutes.

## Tips

Make sure you buy broth with ingredients that are as close to pure beef broth as possible. You want to avoid ones that include celery, carrot, onion, and/or garlic powder.

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 158 | 4 | 15 | N/A | 14 |

## Ingredients

### EGG ROLL FILLING

- ~505g total cooked weight
- 5g avocado oil (ground beef)
- 448g 96% lean ground beef
- 6g MSG
- 5g avocado oil
- 130g onion, diced
- 5g garlic, minced
- 3g chili powder
- 3g cumin
- 3g coriander
- 3g smoked paprika
- 1g black pepper
- 60g tomato sauce
- 50g beef broth
- 3g salt

### EGG ROLL

- 1 egg roll wrap (60 cal)
- 14g fat-free cheddar cheese, shredded
- 35g Egg Roll Filling
- 30g oil (for frying)

## Directions

1. Add avocado oil to a preheated pan on medium heat and add ground beef to the pan by crumbling in bite-sized chunks.
2. Add MSG evenly across the beef, break down beef even more using a wooden spatula, and stir constantly until meat is cooked.
3. Set meat aside on a plate or into a container, wipe down pan, place back on the stovetop, and add avocado oil.
4. Add chili powder, cumin, coriander, smoked paprika, and black pepper to a small bowl and mix.
5. Add onions to pan, mix around so oil is spread evenly throughout, and cook 2-3 minutes or until onions become translucent.
6. Make room in the middle of the pan, add garlic, and stir. Make room in the middle of the pan again, add the seasoning mix, let it sit for 20-30 seconds, then add cooked meat into the pan. Mix well.
7. Once combined, add beef broth and tomato sauce, mix together, and turn burner to low to let the mixture simmer for about 10 minutes.
8. Once Egg Roll Filling has reduced, put on a plate, and let it cool for 10-15 minutes.
9. Into a 5 or 6" pan add oil and turn on medium heat.
10. Fill a small bowl with water and set aside. Lay an egg roll wrap on the counter.
11. Into the middle of the egg roll wrap, add cheese and filling, and pack together. Using a brush, dampen a ½-inch square with water on the edge of the wrap.
12. Bring one of the corners of the egg roll wrap over the filling, tuck the inside of the egg roll wrap into the filling, put water on the corners of the wrap, and fold the corners towards the middle. Brush water on the edges of the wrap and roll it up.
13. Making sure the egg roll is tightly wrapped is important because if anything gets out, oil will splatter and it not only makes a mess, but it can burn you.
14. Bring oil in the pan to 375°F. Carefully lay the egg roll corner side down and flip after 2 minutes or when browned.
15. If the sides of the egg roll need to be fried, use tongs and lay egg roll on its side. Repeat for other side if necessary.

## Tips

If you want to use the egg roll filling for a different recipe, it works perfectly in the CHEESY GORDITA CRUNCH as well.

## Tips

Instead of blending every gram of watermelon, put some chunks in containers to have as a quick snack or great pre-workout meal.You can buy pre-cut fruit to make the first part of this process go much faster, but it will also be much more expensive to do so. In addition, after you cut and puree the watermelon you will have enough for 10+ sorbets, so it's worth putting the extra work in.

8. Using the other pan, add 4 grams of avocado oil and half of the steak. Spread the steak evenly over the pan’s surface and brown for 2-3 minutes. Toss the steak, continue cooking for an additional 1-2 minutes, and transfer to a large bowl.
9. Once the timer goes off, remove the sheet pan from the oven and using tongs, mix the vegetables around the pan. After the vegetables are evenly spread out, place the sheet pan back in the oven and set another timer for 10 minutes.
10. Finish cooking the remaining steak by repeating Step 8. Add the cooked steak to the bowl with the rest of the finished steak.
11. Add the roasted stovetop vegetables into a food processor along with ROASTED GARLIC, cilantro, lime juice, water, and salt. Blend the ingredients for 1-2 minutes.
12. Grab the bowl from the freezer, add the salsa to it, and place back into the freezer for 4-5 minutes.
13. Once the timer goes off, turn the broiler on high, mix the vegetables around the pan, and broil them for 2-3 minutes.
14. Add the roasted vegetables to the cooked steak and mix thoroughly.
15. Into a medium bowl, add tomato sauce, chicken bouillon, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, and oregano. Mix thoroughly.
16. Add chicken broth into a measuring cup and microwave for 1-2 minutes or until broth has reached 120°F.
17. Turn the pan that roasted the vegetables onto medium heat, add avocado oil and rice into the pan, and stir to combine. Frequently stir the mixture until the rice has become golden brown.
18. Add the tomato sauce into the pan, stir to combine, and cook for 30 seconds.
19. Add the chicken broth and stir to combine. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low, cover with a lid, and cook for 12 minutes.
20. Keeping the lid on, move the pan off the heat, let it sit for 15 minutes, and stir to combine.
