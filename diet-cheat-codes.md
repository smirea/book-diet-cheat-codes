INTRODUCTION
When a diet of chicken, broccoli, rice, and unsalted almonds
with a side of plain oatmeal was considered the only way
to lose weight, this is exactly what I used to tell myself —
REPEATEDLY. This was before Instagram was created and
YouTube had juuuuuust started becoming popular, but there
were no recipes or quality nutrition information yet. Unless
you were in Greg Doucette’s kitchen every morning, there
was no anabolic diet and “if it fits your macros” was practiced by very few, if anyone at all, and most certainly wasn’t
common knowledge.
I tried many times to eat copious amounts of hard-boiled
eggs and plain chicken to “finally lose the weight and keep
it off.” For some reason, with every attempt, I kept telling
myself that this time would be different. This time I would
be able to do it forever. This time I would be able to push
through. Without fail, 12, or MAYBE 16 weeks later, I would be
sick of the same food, look pretty good in the mirror, and say
“Fuck it”. I’d go right back to my old ways of Chinese takeout multiple nights a week parlayed with my favorite pizza
place and McDonald’s® the other nights of the week. On
the weekend, it was time to go out with the boys and drink
copious amounts of alcohol and end the night with a full
bag from Taco Bell® that I would demolish before I went to
sleep. Funny enough, during some of these fat loss phases,
I was still working out 4 or 5 times a week, but you can’t
outwork alcohol, fast food, and a massive appetite. In just 2
or 3 months, I was right back to where I started, if not even
heavier and worse off.
As YouTube started to become more educational, I would
watch people like Layne Norton and Zach Rocheleau
(TheFlexibleDietingLifestyle). They started to teach me
that you can eat the stuff you like in moderation, but you
can also make it at home using lower calorie ingredients
and eat it ALL. THE. TIME. This was about the same time I
was in college, majoring in exercise physiology and learning
about the laws of thermodynamics and calories in/calories
out. All of this new information coupled with more low-calorie meal options popping up in grocery stores (think protein pancakes) started changing my mindset. At this point,
I slowly started cooking more and learning my way around
the kitchen.

Fast forward a couple of years and Greg Doucette made a
splash onto the scene. Once anabolic french toast was introduced to me, I realized the possibilities really were endless.
My goal moving forward was to make recipes that not only
helped me lose weight, but tasted great — even if I was eating them day in and day out for weeks on end. I started making my protein ice cream recipes and the rest is history.
So, why should you care?
I mean you really shouldn’t.
However, the process of finding meals that are easy to fit
into your schedule, you never get sick of, and get you to (or
close to) your physique goals is going to take time. We haven’t even talked about the amount of calories you need to
be eating, how many times a day you like to eat, and what
parts of the day you should be having bigger meals. Oh, and
let’s not forget about all the different variables that come into
play when trying to combine diet with exercise too.
With all the information we have at our fingertips, you should
be able to figure it out a lot faster than I did, but it is also okay
if it takes you a few years to learn exactly what works for
you and your body. It took me over 10 years of trial and error
to find what works for me. (That’s well over 3,000 days for
anyone counting.) Shit, even to this day I am still finding new
foods and different techniques that are helping me progress.
Hopefully your journey to finding what works for you will be
a lot shorter than mine, but always remember, learning takes
a lot of time and repetition.
My goal with this book is to make all the information as easy
to digest as possible, so you can take the knowledge in the
pages ahead and apply it to your daily life. To this day, I still
make Greg’s anabolic french toast and just that recipe alone
has changed my life in more ways than I could’ve ever imagined. I hope after reading through and testing the recipes in
this book, you find your anabolic french toast and it changes
the way you look at dieting, forever.

DIET CHEAT CODES

WHY DO MY
RECIPES WORK?
IT BOILS DOWN TO 2 WORDS:
B A L A N C E A N D TA S T E
Before I explain, I have a question for you:
What are some of your fondest childhood memories?
One of mine was hearing the ice cream truck coming down
the street. I would run to my dad and ask him for a dollar so I
could go buy an ice cream bar that had those gumballs that
lost their flavor in less than 2 minutes.
Another one was going to DiCola’s every time I would visit
my grandparents. DiCola’s is a well-known seafood restaurant in Chicago that has the best colossal shrimp, clam
strips, and tomato bread I have ever had. Since they had no
indoor seating, we would eat our meal in the car or on a
piece of wood that was in the parking lot.

Since then, my goal has been to make every recipe as close
to “Chicago good” as possible, while also striking a balance
between lower calories, higher protein, and sufficient volume to feel full and satisfied. If you are from Chicago, you
know how spoiled we are with great food from every culture,
so “Chicago good” simply means having the most flavor and
being as delicious as humanly possible.
The best part about the recipes I create is that most of them
are low enough in calories that it allows for going on dinner
dates, having a few drinks, or indulging in some Krispy Kreme®
donuts without worrying about gaining weight. This is pivotal
for anyone and everyone that has a thriving social life, significant other, and/or likes trying new food and restaurants.
However, most of the time, these extras aren’t even necessary.
WHY?

Lastly, were the days my dad worked late. Why? He wouldn’t
have time to cook so we would go to Bill’s Place, a local
restaurant, to pick up dinner. I would either get a gyro, a ham
and cheese pita (not-so-coincidentally also in this book), or
a slice of pizza.

In this book you will be able to make pizza, ice cream, famous
fast food items, burgers, and more — and all these recipes
taste nearly as good as the full calorie version. Because
of this, you will never have to sacrifice the foods you love
because of your “diet.”

B U T H O W D O E S T H I S R E L AT E T O M Y R E C I P E S
WORKING?

Now, my childhood memories live on, and it is impossible to
feel like I am missing out on any of my favorite foods when
I can make them all at home. Not only that, but when I do
want dinner from my favorite pizza place, for example, I can
easily fit it into my diet with all the low-calorie options I could
eat earlier in the day.

Some of my greatest memories revolved around food and
with over 30 years of these experiences, it would be near
impossible to change. For as long as I can remember, my
goal has been to develop a diet that I could adhere to indefinitely. After several years of attempting to only eat “clean
foods” and completely depriving myself of the foods I always
loved, I realized I needed to try and make my favorite foods
fit into my day-to-day diet. If I didn’t, I would fail each and
every time I dieted.

To me, this is the best of both worlds and keeps me at my
best physique of all time with minimal effort.

Why Do My Recipes Work?

DIET CHEAT CODES

PANTRY
ESSENTIALS
There are ingredients I like to have in my pantry and then there are ingredients I
NEED to have in my pantry. Everything listed below is in my pantry or fridge 24/7
and work in unison with one another. For example, if I woke up at 4am and all the
grocery stores were closed, I could still make a pizza from scratch. How? Because
I always have flour, vital wheat gluten, instant yeast, salt, canned tomatoes, and
mozzarella on hand. If you are a fan of making as little grocery trips as possible, I
highly recommend having these items in your house.

V I TA L W H E AT G L U T E N
If you are going to be baking any
bread or making any pizzas, I would
highly recommend having a bag of
vital wheat gluten in your pantry. It has
the same grams of protein per serving
as protein powder, but costs a fraction
of the price. If you buy a bag of vital
wheat gluten, it will last you months
and is worth every penny.

ERYTHRITOL
Erythritol is an artificial sweetener or
sugar substitute that is used to sweeten
recipes without adding additional calories to them. Erythritol was used to test
and create all the recipes that include a
sweetener in this cookbook. In my opinion, erythritol cooks, bakes, and tastes
the best. If you prefer another sweetener, feel free to use it as a substitute.
The two brands of erythritol I have experience with are Swerve® and Purecane®. I
would get both a granulated version and
brown sugar version as both are used
frequently throughout this cookbook.

Pantry Essentials

FLOUR
PROTEIN POWDER
The protein powder I use is a whey/
casein blend and more specifically is
made by PEScience. Whatever brand
you choose, make sure you get a
whey/casein blend. Also, if you are
only going to have one flavor on hand,
make sure it is vanilla. It works with
almost any recipe and can easily be
modified. For example, if you need
chocolate protein powder, you can sub
in some cocoa powder along with a
little bit of extra sweetener.

Flour is essential in any pantry and
that is because it is used in various
recipes. From pizzas, to muffins, to
baguettes, to cookie dough, flour is
necessary. If you are only going to buy
one, get all-purpose flour. If you want
to splurge a little bit, get all-purpose
flour, but also add King Arthur® bread
flour to the arsenal. For the quality,
how long it will last in your pantry, and
how many recipes you will be able to
make with one four-pound bag, it is
well worth it.

DIET CHEAT CODES

I N S TA N T Y E A S T
I make pizzas, buns, and bread
multiple times per week. To make any
of them, I need yeast. I buy the 4oz
bottle and keep it in the freezer after I
open it. This will keep it fresh and lasts
many months before going bad.

CORN MEAL
Corn meal is a more niche pantry
product, but I always have it stocked.
It is used in my DEEP DISH PIZZA ,
but is also very useful to help load and
unload pizzas from a pizza peel onto a
pizza steel. I also like the texture and
taste it gives to the finished pizza as
well. And who knows, maybe one day I
will make cornbread. :)

COCOA POWDER
Again, cocoa powder is more of a
niche product, but is something
I always have on hand. If I had to
choose one cocoa powder to have,
it would be the dutch version. King
Arthur® also makes a great double
dark cocoa powder that I highly
recommend. If you are going to make
any of my cookies n’ cream recipes,
I would suggest having black cocoa
powder on hand as well.

XANTHAN GUM
Xanthan gum thickens and emulsifies
recipes, so the protein ice creams
come out as smooth as soft serve and
the condiments keep their consistency after refrigerating. Guar gum
is another ingredient I would recommend if you are going to be making
protein ice creams regularly as it gives
the cream an even better consistency
when combined with xanthan gum.
Xanthan gum may seem pricey, but
you only need a gram or two at a time,
meaning you can make 200-400 recipes with just one pound.

BLACK PEPPER
Always, always, ALWAYS freshly
crack your pepper, if possible. I buy
whole peppercorns and I use either
an electric pepper mill or a mortar
and pestle to crush them down right
before cooking.

RED PEPPER FLAKES
There are a ton of ways you can add
spice to a dish, but red pepper flakes
are what I grew up on. I would also
argue it doesn’t change the taste of
any recipe and can easily be added as
a topping to many dishes like pasta
or even a slice of pizza. Red pepper
flakes will be in my pantry for life.

S A LT
A recipe can be cooked to perfection,
but if it isn’t salted correctly your taste
buds will tell you it sucks. Every pantry
needs to have salt and, in my case, I
use iodized salt. It dissolves quickly,
costs 60 cents for a pound and a half,
and I honestly can’t tell a difference
when I use different types of salt on
the same dish. Kosher salt is the most
widely used type of salt and since
this book almost always measures in
grams you can use any salt you want.
If you make one of my dishes and it
is too salty, I would use less salt than
I include in my ingredient list going
forward. Salt preferences are different
for everyone, but you can always add
more salt if you need to. However,
once you’ve salted a dish, you can’t
take it away.

DRIED SPICES
There are no hard rules on how many
spices you should have. Some people
may only need 5 spices and use them
for everything. Personally, I have a
spice rack with about 40 different
spices. If you are going to use a
specific spice, even semi-regularly, I
would have it on hand. If I were forced
to pick 5 spices and throw the rest
away, I would pick red pepper flakes,
garlic powder, onion powder, oregano,
and paprika.

A R O M AT I C S
Aromatics help add a ton of flavor to
your food with little effort. There are
a ton of different aromatics, but the
ones I always have ready to go are
onions, garlic, and scallions. Desserts
aside, you will notice many of the
recipes include at least one of these,
if not more.

E X T R A-V I R G I N O L I V E O I L
If you are going to buy one oil for
savory foods, it would be extra-virgin
olive oil. And the only ingredient on
the bottles ingredients list should be
extra-virigin olive oil. This doesn’t have
to be expensive either. At Sam’s Club® 3
liters of EV olive oil costs less than $20
and should last you more than a year,
even if you are cooking every day.

FRESH HERBS
Fresh herbs add flavor and freshness
that dried spices just can’t replicate.
The two I have on hand at all times
are parsley and cilantro. They are both
used in combination in many recipes
throughout the book and work as a
garnish on most recipes.

LEMON
Having 1 or 2 lemons and/or limes in
the fridge at all times is a great idea.
The juice can be added to marinades,
sauces, and as a garnish for several
dishes. Not only can you use the juice
of a lemon, but you can use the outer
lemon for zest that is also a perfect
garnish for both sweet and savory
dishes. Not to mention, lemon water is
delicious.

Pantry Essentials

T O M AT O E S
Having fresh tomatoes in your fridge
is always a good idea, but in this
instance I am referring to canned
tomatoes. At any given time, I have
4-8 cans of San Marzano whole
peeled tomatoes and crushed
tomatoes in my pantry. A few cans of
tomato paste are sitting right next to
the San Marzanos because the two
usually go hand in hand. And I use all
Cento® everything. In my opinion, it is
the superior tomato brand.

AV O C A D O O I L
Avocado oil is a great source of monosaturated fat, and has a neutral flavor
for recipes that call for it. For example,
in a baked good like my PUMPKIN
MUFFINS , I am reaching for the avocado oil every time.

CHIPOTLE PEPPERS
I love having chipotle peppers in
adobo sauce in my pantry because
they last forever and are a great addition to any dish to bring a punch of
smoky, spicy flavor that very few ingredients can provide. If you want less
spice, just use the adobo sauce they
are packed in instead of the pepper.
If you haven’t made my CHIPOTLE
AIOLI SAUCE , stop what you are
doing right now and go make it.

CONDIMENTS
If I listed all of the condiments in my
fridge separately, it would’ve made this
list twice as long, I am a condiment
whore and always keep a bunch of
low-calorie options on hand. Let’s do
a speed run of the staples: no sugar
added ketchup, mustard, Sriracha, no
sugar added BBQ sauce, light mayonnaise, soy sauce, hot sauce, and
buffalo sauce.

MILK
Similar to eggs, milk can be utilized
in countless ways and is included in a
majority of recipes in this cookbook.
Fairlife® is the brand I utilize for all of
my recipes, because it tastes delicious and has double the protein per
serving. If you are ballin’ on a budget,
regular milk will work with all of these
recipes as well!

CHEESE
PA R M I G I A N O R E G G I A N O
Considered one of the finest cheeses
in all of the land, Parmigiano Reggiano
is typically aged for 24 months and
is only produced in Italy. Although
expensive, it is worth every dollar and
a few grams goes a long way. I love
the green bottle parm as much as the
next person, but if you can afford it,
parm reg should have a permanent
place in your fridge.

All cheeses are great, unless your
name is swiss, but when I don’t have
mozzarella in the fridge, I feel naked.
Mozzarella can easily be bought in
8oz or 16oz packages that stay fresh
in the fridge for months before going
bad. When you need it, shred it, and
add it to whatever recipe calls for it.
I always keep both fat-free and partskim on hand.

EGGS
Not much needs to be said about
eggs. They strictly provide benefits
with no downside. Need an easy to
make protein source for breakfast?
Eggs. Don’t have enough calories
for the yolk? Only use the egg white.
Want to make cookie dough, meatballs, or french toast? Eggs. I always
have an 18 pack in my fridge and you
should too.

KITCHEN
GEAR
CUTTING BOARD
Have you ever rushed to the kitchen to attempt a new recipe, only to find out that
you’re lacking the required equipment to finish the job? I’ve experienced this exact
scenario many times, and it’s the WORST. Having the right tools for the job will
not only allow you to create the recipe, but will also make your life in the kitchen
inexplicably easier. This equates to food on the table more quickly while also being
more delicious. I regularly utilize the tools mentioned on this list, and many of them
are featured in numerous recipes throughout this book. While a few items on the
list are only necessary in specific circumstances, after reading the details about
each item, you should be able to decide whether or not you’d like to add them to
your assortment of kitchen gear.

SCALE
If you don’t have a scale, you won’t be
able to make the recipes in this book,
so that is why it is numero uno on this
list. A scale only costs between $20$30 and if you buy a good one it will
last you many years. Just make sure
you buy one that weighs to .01 grams,
so ingredients will get picked up by
the scale, even if it is less than a gram.

20

Kitchen Gear

The chef’s knife goes hand in hand
with the cutting board. I personally
like having a set of cutting boards that
includes a small, medium, and large
board to use in different scenarios.
However, if I had to pick one, I would
get a large cutting board. By large I
mean at least 18” wide and 12” long. If
you have the space, a 24”x18” board is
even better. This is because you can
get all your prep work done without
having to find other plates or accessories to put the chopped ingredients on.
Ideally, you can cut all your vegetables
on the same cutting board before
transferring them to a sperate bowl or
preheated pan. Also, you won’t need to
wash it multiple times during a recipe.

CHEF’S KNIFE
Chopping, dicing, and slicing is a
regular step in many of the recipes
contained in this book and a chef’s
knife is an essential tool to have in the
kitchen. While a knife block with an
assortment of knives is extremely convenient, you only need one 8-9” chef’s
knife to get the job done 95% of the
time. I use a knife that costs around
$30, and it has completed its job for
over a year. Every once in a while, you
will need to sharpen it, but that is no
different than any knife, even ones that
cost hundreds of dollars.

SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE
POTS
This is one of the areas I would
recommend all sizes. Large pots are
necessary to make pasta or COOKED
MARINARA while small pots are great
for, well, small parts of a recipe. A
couple examples include making garlic
butter or a nacho cheese sauce.

DIET CHEAT CODES

L A R G E N O N S T I C K PA N
I love my cast iron and it is next on the
list, but a nonstick pan is my go-to for
many recipes because it really makes
the cooking AND cleaning experience
so much easier. Eggs are a breeze,
grilled cheeses brown to perfection,
stir frys come together in minutes, and
pancakes comes out perfect every
time. I would get one that is 12” and
have that be your daily driver.

12” CAST IRON
Cast iron pans will literally last you
generations and can cook certain
recipes better than any pan I have
used before. Steaks get a perfect sear,
smashburgers get scraped off to keep
all the tasty char on the burger, and
deep dish pizzas get a crispy crust
while being perfectly melty in the
middle. There is a little bit of a learning
curve to clean and maintain a cast
iron, but once you get it down, it is an
essential item for any home cook.

S H E E T PA N
Sheet pans have become one of my
favorite pieces of kitchen gear. You
can make a weeks worth of roasted
vegetables in one go OR you can
make a family sized pizza with minimal
effort. They will last forever and are an
essential part of my cooking.

EXTRA SMALL BOWLS

M E TA L T O N G S

Extra small bowls are great for a faster
prep or for dipping sauces. I like to
have my ingredients chopped and
separated into these bowls before I
start cooking, especially for recipes
that cook quickly.

A good pair of tongs last forever. I still
have the ones my dad gave me that
have been in use for 30+ years. I love
a spatula, but when you need more
control, tongs come in clutch.

SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE
BOWLS

MEDIUM WHISK

Some of the recipes inside this book
won’t need any bowls while some will
require all three sizes. It is good to
have 2 or 3 bowls of each size just in
case you need multiple of the same
size in one recipe.

MEASURING CUP
Typically, I don’t use measuring cups.
However, when it comes to adding
water to dough, I like controlling the
pour and I can’t get that with regular
cups. Plus, I can gauge how many
grams of water are in the cup as I am
filling it up at the sink. The one I use is
made of glass and measures 2 cups.

Whisking is something I do daily.
Having a small and large whisk is nice,
but if I only had a medium whisk, I
would still be able to complete all the
steps necessary to make any recipe in
this book, so invest in a good one.

WOODEN SPOON
Wooden spoons come in handy when
you are cooking something that likes
to stick to the bottom of a pot and you
want to avoid scratching its surface.
What comes to mind instantly is pasta.
It also won’t melt like some other
kitchen utensils might. Get one and
get to cooking.

MESH STRAINER
S I L I C O N E S P AT U L A S
I never knew how much I loved
silicone spoons until I started my
YouTube channel. Scraping the sides
of a bowl or pan mid recipe was a
nightmare before I invested in some
and I wish I knew about them sooner.
They also protect your nonstick and
are great for recipes that call for folding in ingredients.

B O X G R AT E R
Ice cream recipes make up the majority of this cookbook, but the most
used ingredient has to be cheese. I
find myself grating blocks of cheese at
least once per week and a box grater
gets the job done time and time again.

While I don’t use a mesh strainer very
often, I always have one on hand. They
can sift dry ingredients, strain liquids,
and remove seeds and pulp. They are
also great for finishing a dessert with a
dusting of powdered sugar.

CAN OPENER
GARLIC PRESS

M E AT T E N D E R I Z E R
A meat tenderizer breaks down the
muscle fibers and connective tissue of
a piece of meat making for a more tender and flavorful dish. I use it at least
once a week and it is worth purchasing if you prep meat regularly.

I am a hoe for garlic. I will add garlic
to almost anything and if it is my dish
I add extra garlic. My garlic press gets
used and abused and I recommend
getting one for yourself. It is light years
easier and faster than mincing garlic
with a knife and it is used in most
recipes.

I suspect you already have a can
opener, but without one my canned
tomatoes would never turn into pasta
sauce. Make sure you always have one
on hand.

V E G E TA B L E P E E L E R
FOOD THERMOMETER
R A S P G R AT E R
Also known as a Microplane®, I mainly
use this to zest lemons/limes and
grate Parmigiano Reggiano. There
isn’t another kitchen tool like it, and it
comes in handy on a regular basis.

22

Kitchen Gear

Food thermometers are clutch when
making any meat. I always want to
make sure my chicken breasts don’t
become dry and overcooked and that
my steak is perfectly medium rare.
Overcooking can happen in just 5-10
degrees or what can be as little as
30-60 seconds.

I don’t need a vegetable peeler all the
time, but if I want to make recipes like
my FRENCH FRIES or my SLOPPY
JOES I need one ready to go. Luckily,
they are small and don’t take up much
space in any drawer.

DIET CHEAT CODES

CITRUS SQUEEZER
A rasp grater will get the zest off a
lemon and the citrus squeezer will get
the juice out of a lemon. If you have to
squeeze more than half a lemon at a
time, I highly recommend one of these.
They get ALL the juice out and catch
most of the seeds so you don’t have to
pick them out of the bowl.

KITCHEN TOWELS
I wash and dry my hands, what feels
like a million times per day. Kitchen
towels are also great for cleaning up
the work surface and counters while
you are cooking or to quickly wipe
your hands off. I like to have 6-8 towels
in my kitchen because I go through
them quite frequently and don’t want
to wash the same two towels every
other day.

Why would you need masking tape,
you ask? I use it to date all my deli
containers. I was notorious for
throwing something in my fridge then
completely forgetting when I threw it
in there in the first place, so I had no
idea whether it was old or not. I simply
put a piece of masking tape on the
top of a deli container, label it with the
date, put the top on, and throw it in
the fridge. When I am done with the
food, I take the tape off, and wash the
container. Those little pieces of tape
have helped me immensely.

BASTING BRUSH
A basting brush comes in handy when
trying to add egg wash to a bun or to
cover a freshly made pizza crust with
garlic butter. This is another small
kitchen tool that is worth having on
hand.

S P R AY B O T T L E
I use a spray bottle to clean off
surfaces all day long. Fill it with a concentrated cleaning solution and water
for a cheap disinfectant that will keep
things looking spotless.

DOUGH SCRAPER
If you won’t be making any doughs,
pizzas, or breads you may not need
this. However, I make these recipes all
the time, so this tool comes in clutch
on many occasions.

ROLLING PIN
If you don’t make pitas, tortillas, or
pizzas, you won’t need this, but it is a
good tool to have if you do.

SALAD SPINNER
D E L I C O N TA I N E R S
Coming in 3 different sizes, these deli
containers have been a lifesaver. Since
they are stackable, they save room
both in a cabinet and when storing
food in the fridge. They have a very
tight seal and are my go-to whenever I
have recipes, leftovers, or sauces that
need to be put away.

I just got a salad spinner and it has
changed my vegetable game. It does
take up some storage space, but I can
successfully clean and dry a pound
of lettuce in just a couple of minutes.
It has helped in special cases as well,
like drying off the potatoes for my
FRENCH FRIES in just one spin.

If you ever break down meat for tacos,
sloppy joes, or make guacamole, I
would highly recommend this kitchen
gadget. It won’t scratch up the surface
of your nonstick pan and is very simple to use.

If you plan on making bread, it’s a
necessity. If you don’t want to make
protein bread, skip this one.

S E R R AT E D K N I F E
I like having a large serrated knife for
PROTEIN BREAD and a small serrated
knife for PROTEIN BUNS . If you don’t
plan to make any dough-based recipes, you can pass on getting one.

IMMERSION BLENDER
I use an immersion blender all the time
because it is efficient and effective. If
I need to break down canned tomatoes, I can put the blender right into
the can and the tomatoes are broken
down in seconds. If I quickly need to
add a xanthan gum/oil mixture into a
recipe, to prevent clumping, I use the
immersion blender. And don’t quote
me, but I hope to figure out how to
make low calorie mayonnaise at home
and an immersion blender is a must.
A whisk or your hands can substitute
for an immersion blender, but if you
want ultimate efficiency, I would pick
one up.

AIRFRYER
While I don’t have a ton of recipes that
use an airfryer, I think they should be a
kitchen staple regardless. Why? They
bring leftovers back to life, they cook
food faster than a traditional oven can,
and they can cook a side dish while
the main dish is cooking in the oven.
There are MANY more benefits to
airfryers, but these are the top 3 I can
think of.

NINJA CREAMI®
If you currently buy low calorie ice
cream or you want to make low calorie
ice cream, I HIGHLY recommend a
CREAMi®. Making a pint at home costs
about $1 and many low-calorie pints
in the grocery store cost $5 or more.
This will pay for itself in no time and is
probably one of the greatest inventions for the home kitchen. (sorry air
fryer, you are an extremely close second though) The majority of future ice
cream recipes will also be made with
this appliance, so it is a must have if
you want to be eating new ice cream
recipes for the foreseeable future.

FROTHER
This is an appliance strictly used for
my ice cream recipes, so you may not
need this if you don’t plan on getting a
CREAMi®.

NINJA® BLENDER
The Ninja® Blender I have is technically
a 3-1 that includes a blender, food processor, and a single serving bottle. The
blender is used for my old ice cream
recipes while my food processor is frequently utilized throughout the book.

PIZZA STEEL
If you are going to make pizzas or any
recipes that include dough, I would
buy one in an instant. It browns the
bottom of a pizza unlike any other
piece of equipment and reheats frozen
dough recipes in minutes. It is easy
to clean and maintain and sits in my
oven at all times. I use it many times
per week, and I’m just upset I didn’t
start using it sooner. I would buy one
that is 16”x16” so you have room to
work with when placing a pizza onto
the steel and also have the option
of baking an extra-large pizza if you
would like.

PIZZA PEEL
This makes life 10x easier if you are
making pizza. Shoot pizzas into the
oven with ease, quickly grab them
once they are done, and hang the peel
up when you are finished cooking.
If you are going to invest the money
for a pizza steel, I would invest in a
pizza peel as well. They will last you a
lifetime. Make sure you buy one that
matches your steel. If you buy one that
fits 16” pizzas, but only buy a 14” steel,
you are paying more for no reason.

F O R M A X I M U M F L AV O R

There are a million in-depth, scientific explanations for good
cooking techniques out there. However, from the beginning,
my goal in creating this cookbook was to explain everything
in the simplest terms possible. Any actual chefs or experienced home cooks will probably scoff at my explanations,
but as long as they make sense to you and you can apply
them in the kitchen, I am a happy Exercise4CheatMeals.
These are beginner techniques and can become way more
advanced if you want them to be. If a particular technique
piques your interest, I highly suggest reading more articles
or even buying a book to really take your knowledge to the
next level. I recently purchased The Food Lab by J. Kenji
López-Alt and I learned more in the first 30 pages than I have
watching countless videos on YouTube.

Cooking Techniques

I am no different than you and am learning new things in
the kitchen every single day. That being said, as I learn new
techniques and/or improve techniques already in this section, I will make updates. That way, as I learn, you can too.

2. Tenderize your meat.

Tenderizing your meat essentially just means beating your
meat. It only takes a few seconds and ensures even cooking
and tender meat.
a. Place a chicken breast into a gallon bag.
b. Using the flat side of a meat tenderizer, pound the
chicken gently, starting from the center of the meat and
working your way out.

P R E PA R I N G C H I C K E N B R E AS T S

c. Once the entire breast is about a half inch thick, it is
finished.

It took me more than 10 years to make chicken breasts that I
can enjoy without any sauces, oils, or seasonings.

d. Repeat for any remaining chicken breasts.

Just salt and chicken.
Don’t make dry and bland chicken like I did for over a
decade. Simply apply the following steps before cooking
your chicken.
Trim your chicken breasts, ideally using kitchen
scissors.
Everyone has had an experience where they bite into a
chicken sandwich and it is rubbery, gross, and ruins the rest
of the meal. This is typically caused by tendons, and we can
remove them quickly and easily along with any excess fat.
1.

a. Place the chicken breast on a cutting board with the
smooth side facing up.
b. Using scissors, remove any visible tendons and fat from
the chicken breast.

3. Salt your chicken.

Salt can come in many forms, but this step is crucial to retain
as much moisture in your chicken breasts as possible. Nine
times out of 10, I either dry brine my chicken or throw it in a
bag, add a marinade, and let it sit overnight. Then, I cook it
the next day. If you have never brined chicken before, check
the next cooking technique!

c. Flip the breast over and find the tendon. It usually runs
down the middle of the breast and ends in the thick part
of the breast towards the corner.
d. Cut the corner of the chicken breast to remove the
tendon and any fat that may not have been removed
from the chicken before it was packaged.

B R I N I N G / D R Y B R I N I N G M E AT
WHAT: Salt is added directly on the meat itself or it is dissolved
in water and the meat is added to the saltwater solution.
WHY: A brined piece of meat can hold more moisture than

the same cut of meat that wasn’t brined. The ability to retain
more moisture will make for a juicier final product. In my
experience, this is the case even when the meat is slightly
overcooked. Brining is especially important in lean cuts of
meat such as chicken breast and porkchops because these
cuts are far more prone to overcooking, which leads to a dry,
chewy, and lifeless dinner.
HOW: For a wet brine, I like to use a 5% salt to water ratio.
This simply means I will add 5 grams of salt for every 100
grams of water.

1.

When ready to brine, add enough water to fully submerge
the meat in your container, add salt, whisk until salt is
dissolved, and add your meat.

2. Cover with a lid or plastic wrap, refrigerate, and let the
meat brine for at least an hour, as long as 12 hours.
a. Everyone’s palate is different, so I suggest testing different
lengths of brine time to get the perfect saltiness for
you. However, I would be careful as wet brines are very
powerful and if you leave a chicken breast overnight it may
become too salty for your liking. I would start by brining for
an hour and increase the brine time each time you cook
until it becomes too salty. You will then know your brine
time limit for the rest of eternity (or at least until your taste
buds change). Larger or thicker cuts of meat, such as a
pork tenderloin or a whole turkey, will take longer and will
again be something you have to test for yourself.

28

Cooking Techniques

For a dry brine, I like to use a 1.5% salt to meat ratio. This
simply means I will add 1.5 grams of salt for every 100 grams
of meat. If you would like to make it even simpler, you can
use 1 gram of salt for every 100 grams of meat. The most
important part of a dry brine is to make sure every square
inch of meat is covered. For example, when I dry brine a
chicken breast, I will completely and evenly coat both the
top and bottom with salt. I highly suggest you weigh out your
salt before adding it to your meat. Oversalting is easy to do
if you are pouring straight from the container. Refrigerate the
meat uncovered for at least 1 hour or up to overnight and
you are ready to cook. If you are worried about uncovered
raw meat in your fridge, you can loosely cover the meat with
aluminum foil, making sure it still has room to breathe. In my
experience, dry brining is more forgiving than a wet brine in
that it takes longer for the meat to become overly salty.
THE MORE YOU KNOW: You can also add sugar to your
brine, but I have never done so. If you end up using sugar,
please send me an e-mail or DM on Instagram and let me
know which cut of meat you used and if you think it’s worth
adding.

BROIL
1.

Preheat broiler on high.

2. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil and place the
vegetables, whole, on the pan.
3. Place the pan in the oven with the top of the vegetables
about 3-4” from the broiler. Some ovens have the broiler
below the oven, but for most ovens this means placing the
sheet pan on the top rack of the oven.

or under a broiler.

WHY: Some people think vegetables are gross. I used to be

4. Broil the vegetables for 3-10 minutes, or until the skin is
charred and blistered on all sides.
5. Using tongs, occasionally turn vegetables to ensure even

6. Remove from oven and let cool for 15 minutes.
• Some people will tell you to put the vegetables in a
bowl and cover with a lid to steam them. This method

• Make sure you don’t soak them in oil unless you need

*Vegetables that I commonly like to broil are red peppers,
poblano peppers, and green peppers. This is another good
place to experiment with other vegetables and see what
you like!

3. Place vegetables on a sheet pan lined with parchment
paper and arrange in a single layer.
4. Bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 20-40 minutes,

of cooking times, especially with the added variable
of different ovens. This is where you will have to
experiment and see what works for your palate.

ROASTED GARLIC

KNEADING DOUGH
WHAT: Rolling a formed dough back and forth on a work

WHAT: Putting a head of garlic into an oven.

surface.

WHY: I always keep roasted garlic in my fridge because it
is an easy addition to a main dish, side dish, or sauce as an
instant flavor boost with minimal effort. Since I use roasted
garlic in various dishes throughout the cookbook, I thought
roasted garlic deserved its own section.

WHY: When the dough is kneaded properly, it develops gluten, improves texture, and increases elasticity aka makes it
easier to shape before cooking.

HOW: Get a knife, aluminum foil, and salt.

1.

Take a full head of garlic and chop off the top so that the
tips of the cloves are exposed.

HOW: Kneading gets a bad rap, but is actually extremely simple. I recommend doing it while listening to music, watching
a tv show, or watching your favorite YouTuber.

1.

Lightly dust your work surface with flour and place your
dough on it.

2. Lightly spray top with oil, add a pinch of salt, and a dash
of pepper.

2. Press dough down and away from you using the heel of
your hand.

3. Wrap the garlic head in aluminum foil and bake in a
preheated 400°F oven for 45 minutes.

3. Fold the dough in half and press it down, pushing it away
from you as you do so to elongate it just enough to fold
it again.

TIP: I highly recommend making at least a few heads of garlic at once. Once you see how simple it is to do and how it
adds great flavor to almost any dish, you will find yourself
going through multiple heads per week.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the dough becomes smooth
and elastic. This usually takes 5-10 minutes.
5. Shape the dough into a ball and place it into an oiled bowl
or container and cover for 1-2 hours or according to the
recipe’s instructions.
*I purposely formulated most of my recipes so kneading wasn’t
required. However, if you feel your dough is too wet, shaggy, or
stiff, it wouldn’t hurt to knead it for 5-10 minutes before putting
it in a bowl to rise.

P I C K L I N G V E G E TA B L E S
WHAT: A salt solution used to preserve vegetables while

enhancing their flavor.

WHY: To be frank, they are delicious. Bread + butter pickles anyone? In all seriousness, pickled vegetables massively extend the shelf life of the vegetable while improving
their flavor. They are also extremely convenient while being
insanely versatile. Grab them out of the fridge and add them
to a sandwich, salad, or eat them straight out of the jar.
HOW:

1.

Slice vegetables into desired size and shape. Place them
in a glass jar or plastic container.

2. Boil even parts water and vinegar along with salt and any
spices you want to add for additional flavor.
• Common spices added are garlic cloves, black
peppercorns, and dill.
3. The amount of salt added will vary depending on what
vegetables you are using and personal taste preferences,
but a good rule of thumb is to add 15-30 grams of salt per
every 1000 grams of vinegar solution.
4. Once the vinegar solution comes to a boil, remove from
heat, let it cool for 5-10 minutes, and pour over the sliced
vegetables.
5. Cover with a lid and allow it to come to room temperature.

BLOOMING SPICES
WHAT: Adding ground spices to a hot pan with a thin layer

of oil.

WHY: How long ago were your spices dried and ground?
The first time someone asked me this question it opened my
eyes, wide. Some of the seasonings in your pantry could be
months, if not years old, even if you recently bought them.
When cooking, blooming spices will help release their natural oils and aromas while simultaneously creating a smoother
texture in a dish. Simply put, blooming your spices will
enhance the flavor of any dish with nearly zero extra effort.
HOW:

1.

Add spices to a small bowl and mix to combine.

2. If your preheated pan is empty, add a few grams of oil
to the middle of the pan. If the pan has food in it already,
create a “dugout” in the middle of the pan and then add
oil. Let the oil heat up for 20-30 seconds and then add the
seasonings.
3. Mix the seasonings with the oil and let them cook for 3060 seconds or until they become fragrant.
a. If the pan is very hot, continuously stir the oil/spice
combination to prevent burning.
4. Combine the rest of the food with the seasonings and
continue following the recipe’s instructions.

6. Store in the fridge and allow those flavors to develop. The
longer you let it sit, the stronger the flavor will be. Most of
these vegetables should stay good in the fridge for up to
6 months.

FIBER PER 100G FRUITS
A N D V E G E TA B L E S
Knowing how many calories are in fruits and vegetables is
great, but knowing how much fiber is in them can be a game
changer. I can write a whole book about fiber, but let’s keep
it simple. The FDA recommends we eat at least 25 GRAMS
OF FIBER PER DAY . Consuming enough fiber every day
helps regulate blood sugar, LOWER CHOLESTEROL, LOWER
BLOOD PRESSURE , and keeps you full. AKA it has so many
benefits there is really no reason not to consume it.

Fiber forms a gel-like substance slowing the digestion of
your food through your intestines and makes you feel full
faster and longer. While having a sufficient amount of fiber
every day is recommended, this can be difficult if you don’t
know where to get your fiber from. This is further reiterated
by the data showing that 95% of people don’t meet DAILY
FIBER RECOMMENDATIONS. In the charts below, I have listed
14 different fruits and vegetables that have varying fiber per
100g. If you would like to see the fiber amounts in every fruit

ASKED
QUESTIONS
Should I eat every meal exclusively from this
cookbook?
While you certainly can eat every meal out of this cookbook,
it’s not necessary. I typically eat 1-2 meals from the book
everyday while also rounding out my other meals with simple snacks, a variety of fruits and vegetables, and leftovers.
1.

2. Am I guaranteed to lose weight if I eat from this

No.

cookbook?

Your calorie intake can exceed the calories you burn everyday even if you were strictly eating fruits and vegetables.
Regardless of the food choices, if you’re in a calorie surplus,
you will gain weight. It is important that you track your calorie intake, figure out if what you are eating is bringing you
closer to your goals, and adjust from there.
3. Are the nutrition facts 100% accurate?

No, but they are as accurate as I could get with the information at hand.
While I am as consistent as possible in tracking each and
every item of food I put into this cookbook, it will inevitably
have errors.
Some common places where discrepancies can occur are
the food label itself, the actual weight of the food vs what the
listed weight says on the label, different dietary fibers, and
the quality of the nutrition label testing.
For example, labels always round the calories down, so what
might be 108 calories is actually labeled as 100 calories. If there
are 5 servings in a recipe that is a discrepancy of 40 calories.
The good news is that companies and labels have been doing
this for decades and people still have success losing weight.
If you aren’t losing weight and are consistently eating similar
things, all you need to do is lower your calorie intake and you
will start losing weight as long as you are in a calorie deficit.

Frequently Asked Questions

(PLEASE READ)

4. How do I accurately track recipes that use

breading or marinades?
The only way to legitimately track the breading is to weigh
out the dry and wet ingredients before and after breading and then divide the leftover into all of the ingredient
amounts. Then you must subtract from the total amount of
each ingredient and log it. Sound confusing? That’s because
it is. This is a tedious process and when I perform tests for
any recipes that utilize breading these are the steps I follow. I
then take the average of all my test recipes and log it into my
calorie tracking app. Save yourself the time and effort and let
me do all that work for you.
As far as marinades go, it is impossible. The videos I have
watched pertaining to this subject show that the marinade
will penetrate the surface of the meat, but I will never truly
know how much of that stays in the meat or gets cooked off.
This brings me back to the last answer, where just adding
100 calories at the end of the day to my daily calorie log is the
way to go. This should make up for anything that was near
impossible to calculate accurately.
5. Do you have any recommended kitchen

equipment?
I made an ENTIRELY SEPARATE PAGE for the equipment
I think is necessary when owning this cookbook and why. I
also made a PANTRY LIST of things I commonly keep in my
kitchen and why, which you should check out as well.
Also, I made an Amazon store page that has the supplies I
use in many of my recipes.
You most certainly do not need all these items and can use
minimal equipment for a majority of these recipes.
For example, if you plan to make ice cream, you need to have
a CREAMi® and/or Ninja® blender to make them. However,
if you won’t be making any ice creams, but want to make
pizzas, then I highly recommend a pizza steel and pizza peel.

DIET CHEAT CODES

You can make pizzas without these tools, but it makes the
process of making and cooking them exponentially easier.
Plus, if you buy these kitchen tools once, you have them for
a lifetime.
6. Does it matter what blender I use for ice creams?

Yes, absolutely! I broke 2 blenders trying to make protein
ice cream before I got my Ninja®. In my experience, and from
everyone’s feedback, this is the only blender I would recommend for long-term use. You don’t need the expensive
one either! The first one I bought was their entry level, $70
dollar blender. You can get them even cheaper on Facebook
Marketplace, both new and used.
Do you have any recommended supplements and
special ingredients?
As noted above, I will refer you to my Amazon store page for
special ingredients, but almost everything can be bought in
store as well.
7.

Some common ingredients in my recipes that aren’t typically
used in most home kitchens are vital wheat gluten, oat fiber,
xanthan gum, guar gum, diastatic malt powder, as well as
many more.
8. Some of these ingredients are expensive, are

they worth it/necessary?
That is something you are going to decide for yourself and
take on a case-by-case basis. For example, vital wheat gluten costs me about $20 for a 4 pound bag, but it lasts me
months. Not only that, but it has the same calories and macronutrient content of protein powder but is about ¼ of the
price. Xanthan gum costs also costs about $20 for a pound,
but even if you ate one ice cream per day, would last you well
over a year.
9. Can I substitute ingredients?

Yes, you can most certainly substitute ingredients. However,
I cannot guarantee perfect results if you try to directly substitute in ingredients. For example, coconut flour for regular
flour. You will have to use some trial and error and attempt
the recipe a few times, if not more, when an ingredient
that doesn’t substitute 1 to 1 is added. I highly recommend
researching anything you will substitute in before you waste
your time making a recipe for it to turn out at best mediocre
to at worst garbage.

10. Is measuring food ACTUALLY important?

Absolutely 100%.

In terms of reaching your desired physique, reaching a point
where you don’t have to measure out portions and can eat
intuitively without putting on extra weight is the end goal.
However, this is a process that takes time, effort, and repetition. Even though I can look at a plate and guess pretty accurately how many calories are on it, I still count my calories
when I am trying to lose weight. It takes all the guess work
out of it and will make it much easier to adjust your calories
if you aren’t losing weight.
For example, I had a client that was following a keto diet
and not counting calories before coming to me. He ended up
gaining 17 pounds over a 6-month period. Once he started
counting his daily caloric intake, he realized that every day
he was actually eating 300-500 calories more than what his
body needed to maintain his weight. That revelation completely changed his perspective, and he ended up losing
nearly 50 pounds over the following 7 months.
In terms of recipes, it is also very important. I have seen
firsthand cups and tablespoons measured wildly differently
and can cause the recipe itself to be ruined. The recipes
that include flour or xanthan gum are the most important.
Regardless, spending the $20-30 on a scale is well worth
the investment to make perfect recipes over and over again.
11. Why do some of the recipes call for extra meat/

sauce when the final recipe only needs a small
amount?
There are two main reasons for this.
The size of a piece of steak or chicken varies widely package
to package. One piece of steak may weigh 16 ounces while
another weighs 8 ounces. Also, chicken breasts are usually
sold in multiples, which complicates the situation even more.
It is easier to find a package of 3 breasts and cook them all at
once than to find just one, which leads me to my next point.
Prepping and cooking meat takes time and time is extremely
valuable to most people. It would be tedious to pound out,
brine, and cook one serving of meat every day, so instead I
list enough for multiple meals throughout the week. Then,
for the rest of the week, making the same dish will take a
fraction of the time it did the first day. However, there are no
rules in the kitchen and if you want to make one serving at a
time, that is 100% your call.

Frequently Asked Questions

DIET CHEAT CODES

12. What is the difference between cooked meat and

raw meat?
To keep it simple, cooked meat usually weighs 3/4 or 75%
of what raw meat does because of the water and fat that
releases during cooking.
For example, if a recipe calls for 112 grams of raw meat then,
once cooked, that same meat will weigh about 84 grams.
This value will be slightly different for different cuts of meat,
but this is a great ballpark to use. If you would like to be as
accurate as possible, weigh out your meat after it is cooked
and divide by the number of servings.

If you want to cover all your bases, you can add the calories from erythritol to your calorie tracking app on a recipe-by-recipe basis. I prefer to just add 100 calories at the end
of every day to “make up” for any calories I may have missed,
like calories coming from mustard, a few sprays of oil, or a
small amount of veggies.
17. Why do you use erythritol to sweeten

everything?
Out of all the sweeteners, erythritol is digested the best
while causing the least, if any, side effects.
Has the least calories per 100g of nearly every sweetener.

13. What should I do if I want to eat your cookie

It is the most cost effective.

dough recipe, but I don’t want to eat raw eggs
because I am worried about salmonella?
You have one of two options.

Erythritol replaces sugar in a 1-to-1 ratio in every brand I
have purchased so far.

You can pasteurize your own eggs, which is a fairly simple
process.

18. Can I substitute other sweeteners and/or brands

You can substitute the raw eggs for boxed egg whites which
are already pasteurized.
14. What should I do if a specific ingredient is out of

stock or unavailable in my country?
Please email me at CONTACT@EXERCISE4CHEATMEALS.
COM with the ingredient you are looking for and where you
live, and, if possible, I will come up with a solution.
15. What is erythritol?

Erythritol is an artificial sweetener or sugar substitute that is
used to sweeten foods without adding additional calories to
them. It is about 60-70% as sweet as table sugar. While technically a carbohydrate, it adds very little, if any, calories to a
recipe. It also does not affect blood sugar or insulin levels.
For example, my Lucky Charms Ice Cream has 45g of erythritol and it adds, at most, ten calories to the recipe. If the
same amount of sugar was added in place of erythritol, it
would add 180 calories to the recipe. That is more calories
than in the entire recipe itself!
16. Does erythritol have calories?

This is up for debate as I have seen studies cite that there are 0
calories in 100 grams of erythritol while others have said there
are up to 23 calories per 100 grams. For the purposes of continuity and transparency I did not count the potential calories
from erythritol because there is no clear evidence on the matter.

Frequently Asked Questions

for one another?
Yes, absolutely. I typically use Swerve® or Purecane® for my sweetener, but more companies have been popping up that make their
own brand of erythritol. I would use whatever you prefer, just try
to make sure it is a 1-to-1 ratio when replacing sugar.
However, it is important to note that different brands of
sweeteners have slightly different tastes, effects on a recipe,
and overall sweetness.
19. Why do you mention specific brands on some

recipes?
The first reason I mention specific brands is because that is
what I used and got me to the final dish you see in the pictures throughout the cookbook. Other brands will work, but
may produce a slightly different texture or taste. For example, there are other whey/casein protein powder blends, but
the flavor of the protein powder itself will also have a huge
impact on the taste of the dish. If the vanilla protein powder
you use isn’t that good in terms of flavor, it is more than likely
that your recipe won’t taste that good.
Secondly, there are just some brands that I find to be far
superior to others in terms of taste. Tomatoes are a great
example. Ethan Chlebowski actually did a phenomenal
video about canned tomatoes that you should check out at
some point. In his video, he asks the question, “Are the more
expensive tomatoes worth the price tag?” and then runs a
bunch of tests on them. I have found Cento® San Marzano
whole peeled tomatoes make for better sauces, dips, and are

DIET CHEAT CODES

just better tasting tomatoes overall. Again, feel free to use
other brands if there are ones you prefer.
Lastly, I pick specific brands because of the calories and
macros. For example, La Banderita® tortillas are only 45-80
calories a piece when most other tortillas are 110-220 calories for the same size tortilla. You may eat 2-3 tortillas in a
recipe which will save you hundreds of calories on your daily
caloric intake.
20. Why do some recipes have net carbs added to

them?
Put simply, net carbs are the amount of carbs in a given recipe that the body can actually utilize to store or use as energy
— AKA the carbs that have calories. For example, erythritol
is technically counted as a carb, but as it travels through
your body and is broken down, the body can’t metabolize it.
In turn, it can’t be used by the body as calories and is eventually excreted in your urine.
21. My baked recipe is dry and AWFUL. Why is this in

the cookbook?
There could be a variety of reasons that the recipe didn’t
come out as desired. Some recipes, such as my muffins,
could become dry if overcooked by 1-2 minutes. Other recipes may rely on fats and if substituted or eliminated completely, will totally alter the taste and texture of the dish. If
you have questions about a specific recipe, please email me
at CONTACT@EXERCISE4CHEATMEALS.COM and give me
as many details as possible as to how it was prepared and
cooked and what the issue was. If possible, I will try and
come up with a solution.
22. Why am I getting different calories when I input

the recipe into my calorie tracking app?
For a single ingredient, each brand can have a significant
difference in macros and total calories even if it is technically
the “same” product. Even the same brand can change their
manufacturer or ingredient list every few years causing the
exact same product to have different calories and macros.
In this TABLE , I added frequently used ingredients along
with the calorie count and macros I used to calculate the
total macros for any given recipe. I did this to keep as much
consistency as I could throughout the book, but if you want
to be as accurate as possible, log each product you use
manually into your calorie tracker.

23. Do I have to use fat-free milk in ice creams?

Absolutely not. I have heard of people using almond milk,
cashew milk, and several others. I think milk gives the most
authentic flavor of ice cream, but if you can’t drink cow’s milk
for whatever reason then feel free to use your milk of choice.
24. What if I need more detail than the instructions

have?
While I try to give as much detail as I can in each recipe
throughout the cookbook, there is only so much that can
be explained through words. If there are any additional
questions about a certain step and what it should look like
I highly suggest checking out my YouTube video on the recipe. If it still isn’t clear or you have further questions, e-mail
me at CONTACT@EXERCISE4CHEATMEALS.COM . I will try
and help you troubleshoot what may have gone wrong or
something else you may be able to try.
25. Why are some of the instructions or ingredients

different than your YouTube videos?
In the process of making this cookbook, I typed up and
made every single recipe I ever created. I wanted to make
sure each recipe lived up to my current cooking standard.
As I have gotten more and more experienced in the kitchen, I
have started using different techniques and ingredients that
have made my recipes better. If I made a recipe and felt it
didn’t reach this new standard I went back and tested the
recipe several times with slight tweaks as if I was going to
make a new video on it. Although many of the recipes are
the same as when they were posted, there are a handful I
went back through and updated to make a tastier and more
flavorful dish.
26. What if my dough is too dry or too wet?

Luckily, the solution is pretty simple, but the reasons for why
it’s happening are pretty complex. If you are making a recipe
that includes dough and it’s either too wet or too dry, you
will need to:
• Add 5-10g of liquid.
• Add 5-10g of flour.
If you have to add more flour, just note that for next time and
use less liquid so you don’t have to add calories to the dish.
Although I test every recipe several times to make sure it can
be universally used, dough can be affected by the season,
the humidity or lack thereof, the brand of flour, and more.

8. Transfer to desired drinking container, top with the rest of the Mix-ins and toppings, and enjoy!

## Tips

For an even better eating experience, after step 7, line a large glass with the sea salt caramel. Then sprinkle some of the Mix-ins into the glass which will stick directly onto the caramel. Pour the ice cream into your glass, top with remaining caramel and Mix-ins, and continually get bites filled with caramel, oreo®, and brownie as you eat your way down the glass.

## Tips

You can use pre-packaged frozen strawberries or buy your own from the store. If you buy fresh from the produce sections just cut off the stem of the strawberries and add them to a plastic bag. They should be frozen and ready to go in just a few hours. If you want an even deeper strawberry flavor, substitute some of the ice for frozen strawberries. Just make sure you account for any changes in your calorie tracking. Also, depending on the freshness and sweetness of your strawberries you may need to add more or less granulated erythritol.

# BURRITO TORTILLAS

**Serves:** 2 | **Prep:** 60 MINS | **Cook:** 3 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 177 | 4 | 37 | 22 | 14 |

## Ingredients

### DRY

- 42g all-purpose flour
- 30g vital wheat gluten
- 30g oat fiber
- 2g baking powder
- 2g salt
- 2g xanthan gum

### WET

- 6g avocado oil
- 85g water

## Directions

1. Add Dry Ingredients into a medium-sized bowl and whisk to combine.
2. In a separate bowl, mix the Wet Ingredients together, add to the Dry Ingredients, and mix with a spoon until most of the ingredients come together.
3. Dump the contents of the bowl onto the counter and use hands to incorporate until there are no more dry parts left in the dough.
4. Finish "kneading" this dough by squeezing dough for 30-60 seconds, switching hands with each squeeze.
5. Divide dough in half, form into balls, cover with a damp towel or wrap each ball individually with plastic wrap, and rest dough for 30 minutes.
6. Dust counter with flour, plop a dough ball down, dust top of the dough with flour, and roll out using a rolling pin. If dough starts sticking to the rolling pin, add more flour where it is sticking, spread, and continue. I like to roll the dough 4-5 times then turn it 90 degrees, roll 4-5 times again, and repeat.
7. Once rolled out to 11-12" place underneath a damp tea towel or kitchen towel to prevent the tortilla from drying out.
8. Repeat with the second tortilla and place on a preheated cast iron or griddle on medium-high heat.
9. Cook each side for 30-60 seconds, flip, and cook another 30-60 seconds.
10. Put under a separate wet tea towel or kitchen towel until cool.
11. Use right away or fold and place in a plastic bag for up to 3-4 days.

## Tips

If storing for later use, put tortilla in the microwave for 10 seconds when ready to eat. If making a large batch and need to avoid molding, fold twice, place in a gallon bag, and throw into the freezer. When ready to use cover with a damp tea towel or paper towel and reheat for 30 seconds.

## Notes

I include an extra 8g into the macros of all-purpose flour that is used to roll the tortilla out, even though it is not included in the ingredient list itself.

# HOAGIE ROLLS

**Serves:** 4 | **Prep:** 3.5 HRS | **Cook:** 13 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 308 | 3 | 50 | undefined | 20 |

## Ingredients

### DRY

- 240g King Arthur® bread flour
- 60g vital wheat gluten
- 8g dough conditioner
- 6g diastatic malt powder
- 2.5g instant yeast
- 5g salt

### WET

- 10g Crisco®
- 192g water
- Corn meal
- 56g water (oven)

## Directions

1. Add all dry ingredients to a food processor and mix for 60 seconds.
2. Add Crisco® to the food processor and start blending for 10 seconds. As the processor is blending, add water over a 20 second period and continue mixing for 30 seconds.
3. Plop the dough on the counter, knead for 6-8 minutes, and divide into 4 equal sized pieces of dough. Each dough should weigh about 129g.
4. Roll each piece of dough into a ball, making sure the bottom of the ball is sealed. Line a baking pan with a nonstick liner, space dough balls evenly apart, and cover for 90 minutes.
5. Flip one piece of dough bottom side up and gently roll the dough back and forth with a rolling pin. Continue rolling until about a quarter inch thick.
6. Pick up the dough and place onto the counter in the shape of a square. Roll out the edges to get an even thickness.
7. The dough should be about 6" wide and 6.5" long.
8. Take the top of the dough and fold about half of it onto itself. Using the tips of your fingers, press the edge of the dough into the crease.
9. Take the bottom of the dough and fold it up. It should perfectly line up to the top corners of the dough. Seal the roll by pinching along the edge and sides of the dough. The roll should be about 6" long.
10. Dust a nonstick liner with corn meal and place the hoagie roll directly on the corn meal.
11. Repeat for the other pieces of dough and cover for 90 minutes.
12. Add a steel brownie pan to the bottom rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 425°F.
13. Add a piece of parchment paper to a pizza peel or a cookie sheet.
14. Grab each piece of dough from the bottom, lightly stretch it out from the middle for a couple seconds, and place them on the pizza peel, making sure to evenly space them out. The roll should be about 8" long.
15. Make a cut down the middle of each roll with a sharp knife or bread lame.
16. Heat up 56g water in a microwave for 30-40 seconds or until boiling.
17. Using oven mitts, add the hoagies to a baking steel, pour the water into the brownie pan, and quickly shut the oven door.
18. Bake for 12-14 minutes and immediately transfer to a wire rack to cool.

## Tips

If you don't have a baking steel, you can cook these on a sheet pan with a nonstick liner. There is only 1 difference. About 3-4 minutes before the rolls are finished baking, you will have to flip them to ensure the bottom of the hoagie browns correctly.

|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 0 |  |  | N/A |  |

## Ingredients

### MASHED POTATO

- 70g water
- 17g dried mashed potato

### DOUGH

- 135g 00 flour
- 55g vital wheat gluten
- 6g dough conditioner
- 5g diastatic malt powder
- 24g granulated erythritol
- 5g instant yeast
- 3g salt

### WET

- 40g fat-free milk
- 14g unsalted butter, melted
- Potato
- 1 egg

### EGG WASH

- 1 egg
- 15g water

## Directions

1. Add 70 grams of water into a medium size bowl and microwave for 60 seconds.
2. Using kitchen gloves, grab the bowl out of the microwave, add dried potato, and mix to combine.
3. Add Dry ingredients into the food processor and process for 60 seconds. You may use bread flour instead of 00 flour, but the final product won't be as soft and pillowy.
4. Add milk and butter to a glass measuring cup and microwave for 20-30 seconds. Mix until the butter is melted. The temperature should not exceed 120°F.
5. Add potato and egg into the food processor, process on high, and pour in milk mixture over a 15 second period. Continue to process for an additional 30 seconds.
6. Place dough on your work surface, KNEAD the dough for 8-10 minutes or until smooth, and round into a taut ball.
7. Lightly spray a large bowl with oil, place dough ball into the center of the bowl, lightly spray the top of the ball with oil, and cover for 1.5-2 hours.
8. Divide dough into 6 equal portions, about 97 grams each. Roll each piece of dough into a ball, making sure the bottom of the ball is sealed.
9. Line a baking pan with a nonstick liner and space dough balls evenly apart.
10. With the bottom of your palm, flatten each dough ball so that after rising and baking they will look like a bun. Pop any noticeable air pockets with fingers or a toothpick.
11. Cover buns with another baking pan or damp tea towel and put in a warm place to rise for 60-90 minutes.
12. In a small bowl, add Egg Wash ingredients, whisk to combine, and brush a thin layer of egg wash on the top and sides of each bun.
13. Bake the buns in a preheated 375°F oven for 16-18 minutes, turning the pan halfway through. Place buns on a cooling rack when finished.

## Tips

If not using within 3-4 days, throw the cooked buns in the freezer and reheat them in a preheated 350°F oven for 10-12 minutes.

# PROTEIN BAGUETTE

**Serves:** 8 | **Prep:** 3 HRS | **Cook:** 25 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 321 | 16 | 59 | undefined | 20 |

## Ingredients

- 600g King Arthur® bread flour
- 100g vital wheat gluten
- 500g warm water
- 16g salt
- 15g instant yeast
- 50g water (yeast)

## Directions

1. Add bread flour and vital wheat gluten into a large bowl and whisk.
2. Pour lukewarm water into the bowl and using a spoon, mix everything together until it becomes a shaggy dough.
3. Rinse your hand under water and use your wet hand to mix the dough until there are no more dry parts.
4. Once finished, top dough evenly with salt, and cover for 20 minutes.
5. While waiting, put yeast and water into a glass and mix yeast using a spoon until yeast is covered in water.
6. Add yeast mixture onto the dough and using a wet hand, squeeze the dough repeatedly for 4-5 minutes or until the yeast mixture and salt is completely mixed into the dough. I like to squeeze one part of the dough through my fingers, then move to another part and repeat while occasionally flipping the dough.
7. Cover the dough for 30 minutes.
8. Using a wet hand, perform a stretch and fold by pulling one side of the dough as high as possible then folding it over itself.
9. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and repeat 3-4 more times until all dough has been stretched.
10. Flip the dough over, and form into a ball by sliding your hand underneath the dough and pulling it in a circular motion towards your body. When the ball is formed, the dough should have a fairly smooth surface and look like kneaded dough.
11. Cover the dough for 30 minutes, repeat steps 8-10, spray the top of the dough with oil, and cover for 90 minutes.
12. Lightly dust work surface and top of the dough with flour, degas the dough by punching it down, and flip it onto the work surface.
13. Using a bread scraper, divide the dough into four roughly 310g pieces and put three of them to the side.
14. To prevent sticking, spray hands with oil and push the dough outward to get any big air bubbles out.
15. Fold the sides of the dough, followed by the top and bottom of the dough, flip the dough over, and round it into a ball making sure the bottom of the dough is sticking together.
16. Put the dough ball off to the side, cover with a damp tea towel, and repeat with the other 3 pieces of dough.
17. Let the dough rest for 20 minutes, grab a sheet pan, line it with parchment paper, lightly spray with oil, and put it off to the side.
18. Lightly dust surface with flour, put one of the dough balls in front of you bottom side up, put a little bit of oil on your hands, and press the dough out into a roughly 8x6" rectangular shape while getting any massive air bubbles out.
19. Take the top of the dough and fold about a quarter of it onto itself. Using the tips of your fingers, press the edge of the dough into the crease.
20. Slowly roll the dough down by continually pressing the seams together with each roll and popping any large air bubbles while doing so.
21. Seal the roll by pinching along the edge, lightly dust with flour, and put the sealed side on the work surface.
22. Using both hands, start in the middle of the dough and slowly apply pressure both down and out while trying to keep the seam side down the entire time.
23. Each time the dough is rolled out, apply more pressure, especially at the ends of the dough to give it an authentic baguette taper. This usually takes about 3-5 rolls and should be about 12-14" in length.
24. Put the rolled dough on the parchment paper, cover with a sheet pan, and repeat for the remaining dough balls, making sure the pieces of dough are evenly spaced out on the sheet pan.
25. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 60-90 minutes. Try and make sure the rolled pieces of dough are as straight as possible before rising or else they will most likely be crooked.
26. Spray the baguettes with water, score the baguettes with a bread lame or a sharp knife every 2 inches or down the middle. Bake in a preheated 450°F oven with a small cast iron pan preheating on the rack below. Add 5-6 pieces of ice to the hot cast iron pan when you add the baguettes to the oven and close the oven door.
27. Bake for 25-30 minutes, flipping the sheet pan around halfway through and moving the bread on the inside of the pan to the outside and vice versa.
28. Baguettes are done when you can knock on them and they sound hollow. Let them cool and store any you will not use that day in the freezer.

## Tips

To reheat from the freezer, simply put baguette into a preheated 350° oven for 15 minutes and it will be good as new.

3. Add vinegar, rinse your hand under water, and use your wet hand to mix the dough until there are no more dry parts.
4. Once finished, top dough evenly with salt, and cover for 15 minutes.
5. While waiting, put yeast and water into a glass and mix using a spoon until yeast is covered in water.
6. Add yeast mixture onto the dough and using a wet hand, squeeze the dough repeatedly for 2-3 minutes or until the yeast mixture and salt is completely mixed into the dough. I like to squeeze one part of the dough through my fingers, then move to another part and repeat while occasionally flipping the dough.
7. Cover the dough for 30 minutes.
8. Using a wet hand, perform a stretch and fold by pulling one side of the dough as high as possible then folding it over itself.
9. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and repeat 3-4 more times until all dough has been stretched.

11. Cover the dough for 30 minutes, repeat steps 8-10, and cover for 30 more minutes.
12. Pick the dough up out of the bowl and let it hang to stretch it into a long, narrow piece of dough that is about 5-6" wide.
13. Lay the dough down with the bottom side facing up towards the ceiling.
14. Take the top of the dough and fold about a quarter of it onto itself. Using the tips of your fingers, press the edge of the dough into the crease.
15. Slowly roll the dough down by continually pressing the seams together with each roll and popping any large air bubbles while doing so.
16. Seal the roll by pinching along the edge of the dough as well as each side of the roll.
17. Lightly spray an 8.5x4.5" steel loaf pan with oil, place the dough inside of the pan sealed side down, and let the dough rise in a warm place for 60-90 minutes.
18. Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 25-30 minutes.
19. Take bread out of the pan, add to a wire rack, and let the bread completely cool. This will take 2-3 hours.
20. Using a serrated knife, slice a couple pieces, and enjoy.

## Tips

For optimal freshness, cut the loaf in half and slice from the middle of the loaf. Then put the two halves back together and wrap in cling wrap or use a bread bag to store. I have had loaves for up to 6 days with no staling or mold formation.

- 45g vital wheat gluten
- 5g diastatic malt powder
- 18g granulated erythritol
- 3g instant yeast
- 4g salt

### WET

- 130g fat-free milk
- Tangzhong
- 7g unsalted butter

## Directions

1. Add Tangzhong ingredients into a small pan, whisk until combined, then put on medium low heat. Keep stirring with whisk until it begins to thicken and clump.
2. Switch to a rubber spatula and keep mixing until there is no more liquid left, or it looks similar to mashed potatoes.
3. Place Tangzhong in a small bowl to cool. In a separate glass, heat up milk for the dough until it reaches 110°F (about 20-30 seconds in the microwave).
4. Add Dry ingredients into the food processor and process for 15 seconds.
5. Add Tangzhong and butter into the food processor, process on high, then pour in milk over a 15 second period, and continue to process for an additional 30 seconds.
6. The dough should have formed into a ball. Plop dough on the counter and KNEAD dough for 3-5 minutes.
7. Lightly spray a large bowl with oil, place dough ball into the center of the bowl, lightly spray the top of the ball with oil, and cover for an hour.
8. Press any big air pockets out of the dough and divide into 6 equal portions.
9. Roll each piece of dough into a ball, making sure the bottom of the ball is sealed. Line a baking pan with a nonstick liner, and space dough balls evenly apart.
10. With the bottom of your palm, flatten each dough ball so that after rising and baking they will look like buns. Pop any noticeable air pockets with fingers or a toothpick.
11. Cover buns with another baking pan or damp kitchen towel and let rise for 45 minutes. Place a small cast iron pan on a lower rack in the oven before preheating.
12. In a small bowl whisk an egg and brush a thin layer of egg wash to the top of each bun. Optional: Add sesame seeds over the top.
13. Bake the buns in a preheated 400°F oven, add 4-5 cubes of ice into the cast iron, and shut the oven door right away.
14. Bake for 17 minutes, flipping the pan halfway through. Place buns on a cooling rack when finished.

## Tips

If not using within 3-4 days, throw the cooked buns in the freezer and reheat them in a preheated 350°F oven for 10-12 minutes.

|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 221 | 2 | 31 | undefined | 20 |

## Ingredients

### DRY

- 195g all-purpose flour
- 78g vital wheat gluten
- 3.6g salt
- 4.5g baking powder

### WET

- 365g 2% Greek yogurt

### SHAPING

- 18g flour (for rolling)

## Directions

1. Add dry ingredients to a bowl and whisk to combine.
2. Place yogurt in the bowl and mix with a spoon until a shaggy dough forms.
3. Using your hand, press and fold the dough until fully combined and no dry ingredients remain.
4. Split the dough into 6 equal pieces (about 107g each) and shape into balls.
5. Place a dough ball on the counter, flatten with your palm, then lightly dust the top and bottom with flour.
6. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough 2-3 times, turn 90°, roll 2-3 more times, and repeat until the dough is about 7-8" wide and 1/8-1/4" thick. Whenever the dough starts to stick to the rolling pin, lightly dust both sides of the pita with flour, spread evenly, and continue rolling.
7. Place the pita in a preheated pan over medium heat and cook each side for 1-2 minutes, or until browned to your preference.
8. While each pita cooks, roll out the next dough ball.
9. Move the cooked pita to a tea towel and fold the towel over it to prevent it from drying out. Repeat the cooking process with remaining dough.

## Tips

Freeze any pitas you won't eat within 2-3 days. Microwave on a plate covered with a damp paper towel for 30-60 seconds, or until soft and heated through.

# PROTEIN PITA

**Serves:** 2 | **Prep:** 15 MINS | **Cook:** 3 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 106 | 3 | 19 | 13 | 8 |

## Ingredients

### DRY

- 30g all-purpose flour
- 18g vital wheat gluten
- 12g oat fiber
- 1.5g salt
- 2g baking powder

### WET

- 4g extra virgin olive oil
- 54g water

## Directions

1. Add Dry ingredients to a bowl and whisk together.
2. Add olive oil to the Dry ingredients and mix the oil into the ingredients so it is spread evenly.
3. Add water to the bowl and using a spoon, incorporate the mixture as much as possible.
4. Flip the dough out onto the counter and continue incorporating all the ingredients into the dough making sure there are no dry parts.
5. Squeeze dough ball between fingers, switch hands, and repeat for one minute. This will make sure everything is evenly dispersed throughout.
6. Split dough into two balls.
7. Lightly dust counter and rolling pin with flour, put one dough ball down, and add a light dusting of flour to the top of the dough.
8. Roll dough 2-3 times, turn 90°, roll 2-3 times, and repeat until the dough is about 6" wide and 1/8" thick. - If dough starts to stick to the rolling pin, lightly dust the surface where the dough is sticking, spread around, and continue rolling.
9. Lightly spray a cast iron pan on medium-high heat, place one rolled out piece of dough onto the pan, and cook each side for 1-2 minutes or until browning occurs.
10. Put cooked pita under a damp towel to prevent drying out and repeat for the other pita.

## Tips

Letting the dough balls relax for 15 minutes after step 6 will make the dough easier to roll out. Cook 3-4 batches at a time so that you have enough for multiple days. If you won't eat all of the pitas within 3-4 days, I would freeze them and reheat them in the microwave or on a skillet.

- 5 egg whites
- 1 egg
- Salt, to taste

## Directions

1. Place each tortilla on a separate piece of parchment paper. Tear the cheese slices in half and lay them across the middle of the tortilla leaving about 1 inch of space on each end.

3. Add egg whites, egg, salt, and black pepper to a large bowl and whisk together.
4. Add bacon fat to a preheated pan on medium heat and spread evenly.
5. Add egg mixture to the pan and keep moving the eggs around with a spatula until fully cooked, then place them on a plate or into a container.
6. Chop bacon and evenly spread onto the tortilla followed by the scrambled eggs.
7. Bring the ends of the tortilla in while slowly flipping one side of the tortilla over the filling.
8. Use the end of the tortilla to bring filling towards the middle, seal the filling in, and finish by rolling until completely sealed.
9. Wrap the burrito in parchment paper and repeat the same process for the other burrito.
10. Put burritos in the microwave for about 30 seconds, let cool for a minute, and enjoy.

## Tips

To save time throughout the week, cook a full package of bacon on a parchment-lined sheet pan at 425 F for 10-12 minutes or crisp to your liking. Once cooled, chop into bite-sized pieces and store in the fridge.

# BANANA BREAD MUFFINS

**Serves:** 13 | **Prep:** 15 MINS | **Cook:** 17 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 97 | 3 | 14 | 11 | 7 |

## Ingredients

### WET

- 360g banana
- 2 eggs
- 10g unsalted butter, melted
- 11g avocado oil
- 4.2g vanilla extract
- 80g brown sugar erythritol

### DRY

- 85g all-purpose flour
- 93g PEScience Snickerdoodle protein powder
- 7g ground cinnamon
- 3g salt
- 4g baking powder
- 2g baking soda

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, add bananas and break them down using a fork or an immersion blender.
2. Add the Wet Ingredients to the bowl and whisk to combine.
3. In another large bowl, add the Dry Ingredients and whisk to combine.
4. Add Dry Ingredients into the bowl of the Wet Ingredients and whisk until just BARELY combined - overmixing will result in chewy muffins. To make sure everything is combined, fold the mixture 3-4 times and scrape the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula.
5. Line 13 muffin liners on a sheet pan, add 58g of muffin mix to each liner, and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 16-18 minutes. You know they are done when a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin has some crumbs sticking to it, but nothing wet.
6. Store muffins in a paper towel lined air-tight container or simply throw them in a plastic bag and enjoy for the next 3-4 days.

## Tips

If you want a moister muffin, pull them about one minute before they are done. They will be slightly underdone, but it'll make them so much more flavorful in my opinion.

# JAPANESE PANCAKES

**Serves:** 1 | **Prep:** 10 MINS | **Cook:** 10 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 350 | 11 | 45 | 20 | 39 |

## Ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 40g fat-free milk
- 2.1g vanilla extract
- Pinch salt (~.4 grams)
- 19g all-purpose flour
- 30g PEScience Gourmet Vanilla protein powder
- 1g baking powder
- 25g granulated erythritol
- Dash cream of tartar

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, separate egg whites from the yolks and place yolks in a separate bowl.
2. Add milk, vanilla extract, and salt to the yolks.
3. Into the egg yolk mixture, sift flour, protein powder, and baking powder. You can do this by using a strainer and gently shaking the flour-laden strainer until it is empty. Whisk to combine.
4. Start blending the egg whites using a hand mixer on low speed. When it begins to foam, add 1/2 of the erythritol at a time, and add more once the sweetener is completely mixed in.
5. Once the erythritol has been completely mixed in, the egg whites should be very close to forming stiff peaks and it is time to add the cream of tartar and mix for an additional 30 seconds or until stiff peaks have formed.
6. Take a quarter of the meringue and vigorously mix it into the egg yolk mixture.
7. Take the remaining meringue, pour it on top, and gently fold it in until the mixture has JUST BARELY come together.
8. Lightly spray a preheated pan on low with oil and pipe batter into the pan where the middle of the pancake will be. Let gravity do the work while slowing raising the bag up as the pancake gets taller and spreads out.
9. Repeat for the other pancakes, add a few drops of water into the pan, and cover.
10. Let pancakes cook for 3-5 minutes, lightly spray the top of each pancake, flip, and cover.
11. Let the pancakes cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, plate it, pour some sugar-free syrup on top, and enjoy!

## Tips

The goal here is to not overwork the batter because that will cause the pancake to be noticeably less fluffy. Transfer finished batter to a plastic gallon bag and when ready to cook, cut the corner of the bag off.

8. Line a jumbo muffin pan with large baking cups, lightly spray each cup with oil to prevent sticking, and add 170g of batter to each cup.
9. In a small bowl, add turbinado sugar. Using a zester, add the zest from a medium lemon into the bowl and mix to combine.
10. Top each muffin with the sugar mixture and blueberries. Bake in a preheated 300°F oven for 33-37 minutes.
11. Let muffins cool on a wire rack for 1 hour and store in a paper towel lined air-tight container or simply throw them in a plastic bag and enjoy for the next 3-4 days.

- 15g sugar
- 20g erythritol
- 2g imitation vanilla

### DRY

- 90g all-purpose flour
- 102g PEScience Pumpkin Pie protein powder

## Directions

1. Add all cheesecake ingredients into a high sided container and using an immersion blender, mix ingredients until smooth.
2. Put a gallon bag in a cup, add the cheesecake to it, close the bag, and freeze.
3. Add the dry ingredients to a large bowl and whisk to combine.
4. In another large bowl, add the wet ingredients and whisk to combine.
5. Add dry ingredients into the bowl of the wet ingredients and whisk until just BARELY combined — overmixing will result in chewy muffins.
6. To make sure everything is combined, fold the mixture 3-4 times and scrape the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula.
7. Line a jumbo muffin pan with large baking cups, lightly spray each cup with oil to prevent sticking, and add 140g of batter to each cup.

# JUMBO TRIPLE CHOCOLATE MUFFINS

**Serves:** 6 | **Prep:** 15 MINS | **Cook:** 40 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 301 | 11 | 28 | undefined | 24 |

## Ingredients

### DRY

- 120g granulated erythritol
- 30g sugar
- 4.5g salt
- 90g all-purpose flour
- 99g PEScience Chocolate Truffle protein powder
- 30g cocoa powder
- 6g baking powder
- 2g baking soda
- 5g xanthan gum

### WET

- 1 egg
- 2 egg yolks
- 120g 2% chocolate milk
- 100g 2% greek yogurt
- 10g avocado oil
- 2g coffee extract

### TOPPING

- 56g chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Add the erythritol, sugar, and salt to a large bowl and place a mesh strainer over the bowl.
2. Add the remaining dry ingredients to the strainer and sift them into the bowl.
3. If you only have vanilla whey/casein protein powder, it will work, but it may reduce the chocolaty flavor-add 5-10g extra cocoa powder to compensate.
4. Press any remaining chunks through the strainer, and pour any leftover remnants into the bowl.
5. Thoroughly whisk the dry ingredients, then use a spoon to create a well in the middle of the bowl.
6. Pour all the wet ingredients into the well and whisk ONLY the wet ingredients until fully combined.
7. Switch to a rubber spatula and gently fold the ingredients together until just BARELY combined-overmixing will result in chewy muffins. WHEN finished, fold 3-4 more times and scrape the bottom to ensure the dry ingredients have been soaked up.
8. Line a jumbo muffin pan with large baking cups, lightly spray each cup with oil to prevent sticking, and add 160g of batter into each cup.
9. Evenly top each muffin with chocolate chips and bake in a preheated 300°F oven for 38-42 minutes. The muffins are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few crumbs but no wet batter.
10. Allow the muffins to cool on a wire rack for 1 hour or until the chocolate hardens.
11. Store them in an airtight container lined with a paper towel, or simply place them in a plastic bag. Enjoy within 3-4 days.

## Tips

TIP 1: Turn muffins into lava cakes by baking 4-5 minutes less. TIP 2: Microwave for 10-15 seconds to enjoy a fresh baked eating experience.

## Ingredients

### FLUFFY EGGS

- 6 eggs
- 238g egg whites
- 210g 2% milk
- 4g salt
- 2g MSG

### SANDWICH

- Bagel (110 cal)
- 2 slices jalapeño Velveeta*
- 56g Canadian bacon (60 cal)
- ¼ fluffy eggs
- 20g chipotle aioli

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 325°F. Add water to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a low simmer.
2. While water comes to a boil, add eggs to a large bowl and whisk with a fork. Add egg whites, milk, salt, and MSG, then whisk again until fully combined.
3. Lightly spray an 8" x 8" pan with oil. Strain the egg mixture into the pan using a fine-mesh strainer.
4. Tap the pan gently on the counter to release air bubbles. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.
5. Place the covered pan into a larger baking dish and transfer to the oven. Carefully pour the simmering water into the baking dish until it reaches halfway up the sides of the pan.
6. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the eggs are just set and reach 175°F internally.
7. While the eggs cook, prepare the CHIPOTLE AIOLI.
8. When the eggs are fully cooked, remove the dish from the oven and lift the pan out of the water bath and onto a towel. Let it rest for 5 minutes.
9. Uncover, place a cutting board over the pan, and flip to release the eggs. Cut into 4 equal squares.
10. Lightly oil a preheated pan over medium heat. Add Canadian bacon and sear for 1-2 minutes per side, or until browned.
11. While the bacon browns, toast the inside of the bagel.
12. On a sheet of parchment paper, layer the sandwich in this order: bottom bagel, cheese, bacon, egg, cheese, aioli, and top bagel.
13. Wrap sandwich in parchment, microwave for 30 seconds, and let rest (still wrapped) for 2 minutes to let the flavors mingle with each other.
14. Cut in half and enjoy.

## Ingredients

### WET

- 300g 2% Greek yogurt
- 2 eggs
- 21g avocado oil

- 80g lemon juice
- 4g lemon zest
- 2g lemon extract (optional)

- 4g baking powder
- 2g baking soda

### GLAZE

- 5g unsalted butter

- 35g lemon juice
- Zest half lemon

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, add the Wet Ingredients and whisk to combine.
2. In another large bowl, add the Dry Ingredients and whisk to combine.
3. Add Dry Ingredients into the bowl of the Wet Ingredients and whisk until just BARELY combined — overmixing will result in chewy muffins. To make sure everything is combined, fold the mixture 3-4 times and scrape the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula.
4. Line 14 muffin liners on a sheet pan, add 59g of muffin mix to each liner, and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 16-18 minutes. You know they are done when a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin has some crumbs sticking to it, but nothing wet.
5. While the muffins are baking, prepare the glaze by microwaving butter in a small bowl in ten second intervals until melted.
6. In a medium bowl, add the melted butter, powdered sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest for the glaze. Whisk to combine.
7. Put parchment paper below a wire rack, add hot muffins to the rack, top each muffin with glaze, and spread the glaze around the top of the muffin using a spatula.
8. Store muffins in a paper towel lined air-tight container and enjoy for the next 3-4 days.

## Tips

If you want a moister muffin, pull them about one minute before they are done. They will be slightly undone, but it'll make them so much more flavorful in my opinion.

# STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE STUFFED WAFFLE

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 402 | 12 | 41 | 34 | 36 |

## Ingredients

### CHEESECAKE FILLING

- 60g 2% cottage cheese
- 56g low-fat cream cheese
- 56g fat-free cream cheese
- 1 egg yolk
- 15g granulated sugar
- 20g erythritol
- 1g salt
- 2g imitation vanilla
- 80g strawberries (40g whole, 40g chopped)
- 19g Gorilla Mind Vanilla Ice Cream protein

### WAFFLE

- 50g PEScience Waffle & Pancake Mix
- 16.2g Gorilla Mode Vanilla Ice Cream protein
- 90g water
- 108g Cheesecake Filling

## Directions

1. Place waffle mix and protein in a large bowl and whisk.
2. Add water and whisk until a batter forms.
3. Minus the 40 grams of chopped strawberries, add all cheesecake filling ingredients into a high-sided container and using an immersion blender mix for 2 minutes. You can use a blender cup to do this as well. You may need to scrape down the sides a few times to fully combine.
4. Put the chopped strawberries in the container and stir to evenly distribute.
5. Add 108 grams of the cheesecake filling to a small bowl and refrigerate the rest.
6. Into a preheated Stuffer® waffle maker, add a layer of waffle batter so the bottom grids and waffle divider are thinly, but completely covered.
7. Place the cheesecake filling in the center of the waffle maker. Make sure it is evenly spread out and is about a half inch from the edges of the waffle maker.
8. Cover the filling with the remaining batter until it reaches the top of the square projections on the waffle tongs.
9. Close the waffle maker, flip, and cook for 5-6 minutes.
10. Let the waffle cool for 2 minutes and cut in half. If you wait too long, the filling may be over cooked.

## Notes

You can use any premade waffle mix that you would like. However, you may need to adjust the amount of water used and macros as needed. One batch of cheesecake filling makes enough for 3 waffles.

# BASQUE CHEESECAKE

**Serves:** 8 | **Prep:** 25 MINS | **Cook:** 35 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 372 | 15 | 47 | 28 | 29 |

## Ingredients

- 325g 2% cottage cheese, blended
- 448g low-fat cream cheese
- 224g fat-free cream cheese
- 100g granulated sugar
- 150g erythritol
- 4g salt
- 8g imitation vanilla
- 3 eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- 480g 2% milk
- 40g all-purpose flour
- 97.2g Gorilla Mind Vanilla Ice Cream protein

## Directions

1. Allow cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, and milk to come to room temperature. This will take about 2-4 hours.
2. Add eggs and yolks to a medium bowl.
3. Using an immersion blender, mix the cottage cheese for 2 minutes or until smooth.
4. Add flour and protein to a medium bowl and whisk.
5. Add cottage cheese, cream cheese, sugar, erythritol, salt, and vanilla to a large bowl.
6. Using a hand mixer, blend for 2 minutes on low or until everything is combined. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. You can make this entire recipe whisking by hand or with a stand mixer. Whichever option you choose, just follow the instructions as listed.
7. While mixing on low, add in one egg/yolk at a time until it is fully combined. This should take about 5 minutes in total. Scrape down sides and bottom of bowl.
8. Slowly pour in milk while mixing on low. Once all milk is poured in, scrape down sides of bowl and mix for an additional minute.
9. Add flour/protein mixture to a meat strainer and a sift the powder over the bowl while mixing on low. Once all powder is sifted, mix for one minute and scrape down sides. Mix for an additional minute or until everything is combined.
10. Spray a 10" springform pan with oil, place on a sheet pan, and add mixture to springform pan. You can place parchment paper inside of the springform pan before pouring for easier removal and transfer of the cheesecake. This works for other round 10" pans as well.
11. Bake in a preheated 475°F oven for 35-40 minutes or until brown on top with a slight jiggle throughout the cheesecake. Turn sheet pan halfway through cooking.
12. Allow cheesecake to set for 2-4 hours before cutting into it. The goal is to have a custard-like middle with the outer edges firm.

## Tips

if you can't get fat-free cream cheese, you can use a combination of 500g 2% cottage cheese and 500g low-fat cream cheese.

|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 506 | 13 | 51 | undefined | 48 |

## Ingredients

### DOUGH

- 420g all-purpose flour
- 105g vital wheat gluten
- 6g salt
- 7g instant yeast

### WET

- 340g warm water

### PIZZA

- 16g olive oil
- Dough
- 280g no sugar added BBQ sauce
- 422g chicken breast, cooked
- 224g fat-free mozzarella cheese, shredded

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine flour, vital wheat gluten, salt, and yeast. Whisk to evenly distribute.
2. Add water and mix with a spoon until a shaggy dough forms.
3. Using a wet hand, press and fold the dough until fully combined and no dry flour remains.
4. Cover and rest in a warm area for 60-90 minutes. The dough can safely rise longer than 90 minutes. If you need to leave for 2-3 hours, it'll be ready when you return.
5. With a wet hand, pull one side of the dough up as high as possible and fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl 90° and repeat 3-4 times. Flip the dough, form into a ball, cover, and rest 60-90 minutes.
6. Pour olive oil onto a 21x15" sheet pan and spread it across the entire surface.
7. Remove dough from the bowl, let it hang for a few seconds so it naturally stretches into a rectangle, and plop it onto the sheet pan.
8. Using your fingertips, press outward to stretch the dough across the pan. Cover with another sheet pan and rest 15-20 minutes. If the dough keeps snapping back while stretching, cover and rest 15-20 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.
9. Rinse chopped red onion under water and dry with a paper towel.
10. If the dough has snapped back from the corners, lightly stretch it back into place. Top with BBQ sauce, chicken, both cheeses, and red onion.
11. Bake in a preheated 450°F oven for 20-24 minutes, or until cheese is browned to your preference.
12. Slice into 8 pieces, garnish with cilantro, and enjoy.

# CHEESE AND PEPPERONI SHEET PAN PIZZA

**Serves:** 32 | **Prep:** 2 HRS | **Cook:** 18 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 116 | 4 | 12 | N/A | 8 |

## Ingredients

### DRY

- 420g all-purpose flour
- 100g vital wheat gluten
- 6g salt
- 5g instant yeast

### WET

- 15g extra virgin olive oil
- 375g water

### DOUGH

- 250g FOOLPROOF HOMEMADE MARINARA

### PIZZA BUILD

- 476g part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 71g turkey pepperoni
- Cilantro, chopped

## Directions

1. Throw all Dry Ingredients in a food processor and process on high for 30 seconds.
2. Add olive oil to the food processor, put the top on, turn the processor on high, and slowly add water over 15-20 seconds. Continue processing for an additional 30 seconds.
3. Lightly spray a large bowl with oil, plop the dough on the counter, form into a ball, put it in the bowl, lightly spray the top of the dough with oil, and cover for 90 minutes or until doubled in size.
4. Make FOOLPROOF HOMEMADE MARINARA if not already made.
5. Pour olive oil onto a 21x15" sheet pan and spread around the entire sheet pan.
6. Take dough out of the bowl, let it hang for a couple seconds so it naturally starts stretching into a rectangular shape, and plop it onto the sheet pan.
7. Using the tips of your fingers, start stretching the dough out across the pan and cover with another sheet pan for 30 minutes.
8. If the corners snap back a little bit, lightly stretch the dough into the corners of the pan, then top with marinara sauce, part-skim cheese, and cover half of the pizza with pepperoni.
9. Bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 16-20 minutes or until cheese has a nice browning.
10. Pull it out of the oven, slice, and enjoy.

## Tips

It will not hurt the dough if it rises longer than 90 minutes as it still needs an additional rise anyway. If you need to go somewhere for 2-3 hours, your dough will be waiting for you when you get back. It the dough keeps snapping back when you are stretching it in the sheet pan, cover it and let it rest for 15-20 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax and help the dough stretch.

# CHICKEN ALFREDO PIZZA

**Serves:** 1 | **Prep:** 1.5 HRS | **Cook:** 1.25 HRS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 903 | 18 | 101 | N/A | 88 |

## Ingredients

- 3 chicken breasts
- 1 head of garlic, roasted

### DOUGH

- 10g King Arthur® bread flour
- 20g vital wheat gluten
- 1.5g yeast
- 1g salt
- 91g water

### PIZZA BUILD

- 14g corn meal
- Dough
- 80g roasted garlic alfredo sauce (45 cal)
- 6g roasted garlic
- 105g chicken, cooked
- 7g Parmigiano Reggiano cheese
- 40g fat-free mozzarella cheese
- 40g part-skim mozzarella cheese

## Directions

1. BRINE your chicken breasts.
2. While the chicken is brining, ROAST your garlic.
3. While the garlic is roasting, add the bread flour, vital wheat gluten, yeast, and salt into a food processor and process on high for 30 seconds.
4. While processor is running, slowly add water over 15-20 seconds. Continue to process for an additional 30 seconds.
5. Lightly spray a medium-sized bowl with oil, plop the dough on the counter, form into a ball, and add to the bowl. Lightly spray the top of the dough with oil and cover for 90 minutes or until doubled in size.
6. Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel and add chicken to a preheated 400°F oven for 20-25 minutes or until internal temperature of the chicken reaches 155°F. Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces.
7. Cover the work surface with corn meal, add the dough on top of the corn meal bottom side down, and cover the top of the dough with corn meal as well.
8. Stretch the dough until it is about 11" in diameter, leaving the crust thicker than the rest of the pizza. Lightly dust a pizza peel with corn meal.
9. Toss the dough back and forth between your hands to remove any excess corn meal and place the dough onto the pizza peel.
10. Top the dough with alfredo sauce, garlic, chicken, Parmigiano Reggiano, and fat-free and part-skim mozzarella.
11. Bake in a preheated oven at the highest temperature possible (mine oven goes to 550°F) for 5-8 minutes or until cheese starts browning
12. Add to a wire rack to cool, slice, and it's time to eat.

## Tips

Grill the chicken breasts instead for greater flavor. If you would like slices that don't bend or break, once the pizza has cooled off, I would add the pizza back in the oven for 60-90 seconds. The bottom will become crispy again while holding all the toppings as you eat it.

- 6g fresh parsley, chopped
- 30g white vinegar
- 10g garlic, minced
- 60g lemon juice
- 120g fat-free Greek yogurt
- 12g extra virgin olive oil
- 8g smoked paprika
- 12g salt
- 6g MSG
- 6g black pepper

### CHICKEN GYRO SALAD BUILD

- 300g romaine lettuce, chopped
- 140g tomato, sliced
- 150g cucumber, sliced
- 168g chicken, cooked
- 170g TZATZIKI SAUCE
- 40g PICKLED ONION
- 42g fat-free feta cheese

## Directions

1. Using a cutting board, trim excess fat off the chicken breasts.
2. Add the Chicken Marinade ingredients to a large bowl, whisk until combined, add chicken, and make sure every piece of chicken is thoroughly coated.
3. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour, up to 24 hours for maximum flavor.
4. Prep TZATZIKI SAUCE. If you plan to eat this recipe through the week, double the recipe to make enough tzatziki for 4 salads.
5. Prep PICKLED ONION.
6. When ready to eat, arrange marinated chicken on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and a wire rack and bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 20-25 minutes or until internal temperature of the chicken reaches 155°F.
7. While the chicken is cooking, prep the vegetables and add them to a large bowl.

## Tips

Although there is a lot of prep work for this recipe, if you make it once, you should have enough prepared ingredients for the entire week. The only thing you will have to prep each day is the lettuce, cucumber, and tomato – and even those can be prepared for multiple days at a time if you prefer.

4. Grate 100g of onion on a box grater and drain any extra liquid.

13. Bake pizza in a preheated 400°F oven for 30-40 minutes. Once removed from the oven, top with parmesan, slice it, and it is time to eat.

## Tips

I would wait 5-10 minutes before slicing and another 5 minutes before serving to avoid burning your mouth. You have been warned.

# GARLIC PARMESAN BONELESS WINGS

**Serves:** 3 | **Prep:** 1.75 HRS | **Cook:** 20 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 418 | 11 | 25 | N/A | 56 |

## Ingredients

- 672g chicken breast

### DREDGING STATIONS

- 70g all-purpose flour
- 20g corn starch
- 1g chili powder
- 2g paprika
- 2g cumin
- 3g onion powder
- 3g garlic powder
- 3g salt
- 2g black pepper

### WET STATION

- 15g fat-free milk
- 1 egg
- 1 egg white
- Oil spray to coat

## Directions

1. PREP AND BRINE chicken breast, then cut into boneless wing-sized chunks.
2. While chicken is brining, make GARLIC PARMESAN SAUCE.
3. Add Dredging Ingredients to your wet and dry station containers and mix thoroughly.
4. Add a few chunks of meat at a time into flour mixture using one hand, which I call your "dry hand".
5. Using your other hand, or "wet hand," completely cover the coated chicken in wet mixture and let any excess liquid drip off.
6. Finish chicken by adding it back into the flour mixture and push any of the flour mixture into the cracks and crevices of the chicken to make sure it is completely coated. Add to a wire rack.
7. Lightly spray chicken with oil, then add to a preheated 400°F air fryer oil side down. Lightly spray the other side with oil as well.
8. Cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway through. If you see any white spots after flipping, quickly spray with oil and continue cooking.
9. In a medium-sized bowl, add 220g of cooked chicken and 30g of GARLIC PARMESAN SAUCE. Using a brush, coat the pieces of chicken evenly with sauce.
10. Put any additional servings WITHOUT sauce into meal prep containers.
11. When hunger strikes, reheat in air fryer for 3-4 minutes at 350°F, add sauce, and they will be good as new.

## Tips

You can reduce prep time by nearly 30 minutes by buying a "Better Breader". This device can essentially bread all of the pieces at once without having to go one by one. This is available in my Amazon store if you want to check it out. When cooking, try and make sure the pieces of chicken aren't touching each other. If you need to do it in batches, that's okay.

- 24g beef bouillon

### PIZZA BUILD

- 130g pizza sauce
- 224g italian beef, thinly sliced
- 120g giardiniera
- 8g pecorino romano cheese, grated
- 8g parmigiano reggiano cheese, grated
- 112g fat-free mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 112g part-skim mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced
- Corn meal

## Directions

1. Add flour, vital wheat gluten, yeast, and salt into a food processor and mix on high for 1 minute.
2. While mixing, add butter one cube at a time and mix for an additional 15 seconds.
3. While mixing, add water over a 20-30 second period and continue blending for an additional 30 seconds.
4. Lightly spray a medium-sized bowl with oil, plop the dough on the counter, form into a ball, and add to the bowl. Cover for 1.5-2 hours.
5. Add all sauce ingredients directly into the crushed tomato can and mix. Add to a container and refrigerate.
6. Add all spices to a small bowl besides the garlic cloves and bay leaf. Add spices to a preheated saucepan on medium heat and mix together. Let dry roast for 30-60 seconds.
7. Add bay leaf, garlic cloves, and beef broth to the saucepan and bring to a simmer.
8. Add beef bouillon and stir. Turn the pot to low and allow it to simmer for 30 minutes.
9. Place a strainer over a medium-sized bowl, pour the au jus through the strainer, and wipe the saucepan with a towel.
10. Discard spices, pour the au jus back into the saucepan, and place back onto the stovetop.
11. Add roast beef to the saucepan and heat the beef juice to 140°F. Remove pan from heat and allow meat to marinade.
12. Place a strainer on top of a plate, add giardiniera and allow to drain for at least 20 minutes.
13. Grab the same bowl used to strain the spices and strain the beef. Allow beef to drain for 20 minutes.
14. Using a paper towel, dab the giardiniera to remove as much excess oil as possible and weigh out 120 grams.
15. Using your hands, squeeze as much juice out of the beef as possible and add to a medium bowl.
16. Lightly sprinkle corn meal onto the work surface, flip dough onto the corn meal and add additional corn meal to the bottom of the dough.
17. Flip the dough back over and using a rolling pin, roll back and forth two times. Turn the dough 90° or a quarter turn, and roll back and forth two more times. Repeat this process until the dough is 16-17".
18. Pick up the dough, make two fists underneath it and move the dough in a circular motion. Make sure you go around the entire dough. The dough should be about 12" now.
19. Take the dough and grab the crust by your finger tips. Similar to spinning the dough with your fists, do the same thing to the crust and go all the way around the pizza. The dough should now have reached final form at 14".
20. Roll out the edges of the dough to remove any air pockets and flatten.
21. Place dough on top of a sheet of parchment paper and add pizza sauce, leaving about a quarter inch for a crust.
22. Add remaining toppings in the order listed and add to a preheated 550°F oven for 8-10 minutes.
23. Enjoy an authentic Chicago style pizza.

## Tips

Keep the au jus if you plan to make another pizza or an italian beef sandwich in the next week. Simply reheat the au jus and beef to 140°F and the Italian beef is ready.

## Notes

If there is too much oil or au jus on the pizza, it will end up a soggy mess.

# MANICOTTI

**Serves:** 12 | **Prep:** 75 MINS | **Cook:** 75 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 412 | 17 | 23 | undefined | 43 |

## Ingredients

### CREPES

- 3 eggs
- 480g fat-free milk
- 15g olive oil
- 4g salt
- 35g unflavored whey protein powder
- 50g all-purpose flour
- 10g potato starch

### SAUCE

- 448g 96% lean ground beef
- 6g salt (for ground beef)
- 15g olive oil
- 250g onion, grated
- 3g salt (for onions)
- 2g black pepper
- 25g garlic paste
- 30g Calabrian chilis, chopped
- 45g tomato paste
- 158g Cento® All-in-One Crushed Tomatoes
- 40g water
- 2g salt (for tomatoes)
- 10g fresh basil

### CHEESE FILLING

- 454g whole milk ricotta
- 448g fat-free mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 224g 2% cottage cheese
- 45g Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated
- 284g frozen chopped spinach
- 15g fresh parsley, chopped
- 3g salt
- 3g garlic powder
- 1 egg, beaten

### TOPPING

- 224g part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded

## Directions

1. Flatten ground beef on a sheet pan, season with salt, set oven to broil on high, and place the pan 6 inches from the broiler. Cook 18-22 minutes or until a deep brown crust forms.
2. Add all crepe ingredients to a high-sided container and blend with an immersion blender. A standard blender works too.
3. Microwave spinach 3-4 minutes, then squeeze out excess water using a cheesecloth or paper towels.
4. Combine all cheese filling ingredients in a large bowl, mix well, and set aside.
5. Grate the onion, prep the remaining sauce ingredients, and place everything next to a preheated pot over medium heat.
6. Add ground onion to the pot. Let the excess liquid steam off, then drizzle in the olive oil and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to take on color.
7. While the onions sauté, use a meat chopper to crumble the broiled ground beef into small pieces.
8. Stir the salt, black pepper, garlic paste, Calabrian chilis, and tomato paste into the onions and cook for 2-3 minutes.
9. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, then fill each empty can with 20g of water. Shake the water around the inside of the cans to loosen the remaining tomato and pour that liquid into the pot.
10. Throw the ground beef into the pot, mix, bring the sauce to a simmer, and reduce for 30 minutes, or until a spatula leaves a clear trail in the pan.
11. While the sauce simmers, stir the crepe batter to lift any starch from the bottom of the container. Lightly spray a preheated pan (8-inch surface) over medium-low heat with oil, pour in 62g of batter, and quickly spread it across the surface before it sets.
12. Cook 2-3 minutes or until the crepe loosens when you shake the pan. Flip, cook 10-15 seconds, and transfer to a plate.
13. Repeat until you have 12 crepes. Stir basil into the sauce and remove from heat.
14. Spread a thick 1-inch layer of sauce across the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
15. For each crepe, shape 110g of cheese filling into a 5-inch log and place it on the lower third. Roll the crepe like a burrito with the ends tucked in and place seam-side down in the dish. Make two rows of six crepes.
16. Cover the manicotti with a layer of sauce and top with mozzarella. You should still have about 420g of sauce leftover. Cover with parchment paper, then aluminum foil.
17. Bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 20-32 minutes. Remove the parchment/foil, then bake another 12-15 minutes.
18. Broil for the final 2 minutes or until the cheese browns, keeping the dish 6 inches from the broiler.
19. Plate each manicotti with some of the surrounding sauce from the dish, plus 35g of the leftover sauce.

## Tips

To reheat from the fridge, cover with a damp paper towel and microwave 1:30-2:30. Rest 1 minute, then microwave another 20-30 seconds. To reheat from frozen, microwave at 40% power for 6-8 minutes, rest 1 minute, then microwave at 70% power for 1-2 minutes.

3. Add tomato paste, combine the rest of the Sauce Ingredients thoroughly, and let combination simmer for 1 minute.
4. Put an immersion blender into the can of tomatoes, blend 15-20 seconds or until smooth, add to the pan with the rest of the Sauce ingredients, and stir to combine. You can also crush the tomatoes by hand if you prefer.
5. Once sauce starts bubbling, give it a stir, turn stovetop to low, and let sauce simmer for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. Into a large bowl add milk, bread, and an egg and whisk until mixture looks like a wet banana pudding.

- Olive oil spray

### NICKCHICKEN BUILD

- Buns (110 Cal)
- 1 NickChicken patty
- 15g light mayonnaise
- Lettuce

## Directions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 400°F.
2. Cut chicken breast into medium-sized chunks, add to blender, and pulse blender for 10-15 seconds or until it is a similar consistency to ground chicken.
3. Add ground chicken to a bowl, then add salt and erythritol. Mix together until ingredients are thoroughly combined.
4. Spray your hands with oil so the ground chicken does not stick to your hands, then separate the chicken mix into 140g-sized balls. Form the chicken balls into patties that are slightly wider than the buns, and place on a piece of parchment paper.
5. Set up dredging stations by adding all Dredge Station Ingredients to three separate containers and mixing until well combined.
6. With one hand or your "wet hand," take a chicken patty, submerge it into the first wet station container; let extra liquid drip off, and place into the dry ingredients container.
7. Using your other hand or what I like to call your "dry hand," add the wet patty to your dry flour mixture and push flour into the patty to coat it thoroughly, making sure the sides of the patty are covered as well.
8. Once patty is fully coated, shake any excess flour off, and add to wet station two.
9. Make sure the chicken patty is completely coated in egg wash and let any excess drip off.
10. Put chicken patty back into the dry station and repeat step 7.
11. Place the finished chicken patty on wire rack, mix wet station one with whisk, and repeat the process until all patties are breaded.
12. Cook chicken for 6-8 minutes in the air fryer, or until chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165°F, flipping halfway through. Repeat this process until all chicken is cooked.
13. When ready to eat, toast inside of the buns and chop lettuce.
14. Add NickChicken to bottom bun, then some chopped lettuce. Add mayo to the top bun and complete the NickChicken by closing the sandwich.
15. Put any extra NickChicken's in separate containers and reheat whenever hunger arises.

## Tips

Put some of the dry mix on a plate or in a separate container before putting patty into the dry station. Then you can easily add the dry mixture to the top of the patty after it is already in the dry station container. For best results, use an air fryer when possible. However, you can use a preheated 400°F oven for 20 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken patty reaches 165°F. I recommend using a food thermometer to check the internal temperature of the chicken and make sure it reaches 165°F before removing from air fryer. There will be carryover cooking of another 5 degrees or so while it is sitting. I typically reheat these in a preheated 350°F air fryer for 4 minutes.

| 487 | 20 | 34 | undefined | 43 |

## Ingredients

- PROTEIN BUN (or bun of choice)
- 4g unsalted butter (for bun)
- Two 70g 93% lean ground beef balls
- 5g unsalted butter (for pan)
- Salt and black pepper, to taste

2. Prep vegetables, spread 2g of butter on each bun, then place buns butter side down on a preheated pan on medium-high heat, and toast for 1-2 minutes.

## Tips

If you have a range hood or another way to ventilate your kitchen, I would utilize it. There will be a lot of smoke from the charring of the ground beef that is necessary to get that authentic smash burger taste. If you don’t have a range hood, opening windows with a fan pointing towards the window would also be a great way to mitigate the smoke.

# STEAK TACOS

**Serves:** 5-8 | **Prep:** 4.5 HRS | **Cook:** 10 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 438 | 19 | 25 | N/A | 39 |

## Ingredients

- 2-3lb skirt steak
- Corn tortillas (35-40 cal)

### MARINADE

- 4g garlic, minced
- 5g Tajin original
- 2g habanero powder
- 2g black pepper
- 30g soy sauce
- 20g avocado oil
- 5g salt

### TOPPINGS

- 60g onion, chopped
- 10g fresh cilantro, chopped
- 14g oaxacacheese, shredded

### ONE SERVING

- 3 tortillas
- 126g cooked skirt steak
- 14g oaxacacheese, shredded
- Cilantro and onion, to taste

## Directions

1. Trim any excess fat from the skirt steak and tenderize using pointed teeth side of tenderizer.
2. Place steak in a gallon zipper bag and add all of the Marinade Ingredients to the bag.
3. Close bag and shake to cover the steak thoroughly in marinade. Making sure every crevice of the steak has marinade on it is important for even flavor.
4. Place the bag in the fridge for a minimum of 4 hours and up to 24. More time = more flavor.
5. Turn grill to high and let it preheat for 15 minutes.
6. Cook steaks on the grill, 2-3 minutes per side.
7. Wrap steak in aluminum foil and let sit on the counter for 15-30 minutes.
8. Dice an onion, chop cilantro, and shred cheese for taco topping.
9. Cut steak against the grain into bite-sized pieces.
10. Weigh out 126g of cooked steak, heat up 3 tortillas, add Toppings, and enjoy!

## Tips

When getting your steak from the store ask the deli to cut the fat off for you. This will save you time.You can also do this in a pan, but there will be a ton of smoke. If your kitchen doesn't have a vent hood, you are guaranteed to set off fire alarms. I would suggest opening a couple of windows and facing a fan towards the window to ventilate the smoke.

6. While blending, slowly add your Dry Ingredients into the container.

## Directions

1. Fill a small pot with 1" of water and bring to a simmer. Place a ceramic bowl over the pot, making sure it's wider than the pot. Add the chocolate and melt.
2. Stir in oil with a whisk until combined.
3. Line a quarter sheet pan or small tray with parchment paper.
4. Spread melted chocolate into a thin layer on the pan and freeze until solid.
5. Chop frozen chocolate into bite-sized pieces, quickly transfer to a plastic bag, and freeze. Makes enough for 5 pints.
6. Using a knife, cut a vanilla bean pod down the middle, scrape the beans out of the inside of the pod, and add to a high-sided container.

8. Place the dry ingredients in a measuring cup and whisk to combine.
9. With an immersion blender at the bottom of the container, start blending wet ingredients while gradually adding dry ingredients.
10. Once all dry ingredients dissolve, blend for another 90 seconds.

# MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP

**Serves:** 1 | **Prep:** 15 MINS | **Cook:** 15 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 456 | 16 | 49 | 29 | 50 |

## Ingredients

### MELTING CHOCOLATE

- 113g semi-sweet chocolate bar
- 7g peanut oil

### WET

- 430g 1% milk
- 4.2g vanilla extract
- Peppermint extract (See tip below!)
- 8 drops green food coloring (not necessary)

### DRY

- 32.4 Gorilla Mode Vanilla Ice Cream protein
- .20g granulated erythritol
- .5g salt
- .5g xanthan gum

### MIX-INS

- 28g melting chocolate

## Directions

1. Melt chocolate using the double boiler method.
2. Fill a small pot with 1" of water and bring to a simmer. Place a ceramic bowl over the pot, making sure the bowl is wider than the pot. Add chocolate.
3. Once melted, add oil and mix with a whisk until combined.
4. Line a quarter sheet pan or small tray with parchment paper.
5. Add the melted chocolate to the sheet pan and spread into a thin layer. Freeze until solid.
6. Add chocolate to a cutting board and chop into bite sized pieces. Add chocolate to a plastic bag and freeze. This makes enough chocolate for 4 pints.
7. Add Wet Ingredients into a high-sided container.
8. In a measuring cup, add Dry Ingredients and whisk together.
9. Put an immersion blender in the bottom of the container and start blending the Wet Ingredients together. Slowly add your Dry Ingredients into the container.
10. Once all Dry Ingredients have dissolved, continue blending for 30 seconds.
11. Add the liquid to a pint, put the top on, and freeze for 24 hours.
12. Take the frozen pint, run it under hot water for 60 seconds, load it into the CREAMi®, and hit the sorbet button.

14. Place the previously removed ice cream into the pint, reload the pint, and press the mix-in setting.

## Tips

Peppermint extract strength and flavor is going to vary brand to brand. The two I experimented with are Loranns Oils® and McCormick's®. They both taste great in mint ice cream, but have their differences. McCormick's® is a more laid back mint flavor while LorAnn's® is much more intense. If using McCormick's®, use 12 drops. If using LorAnn's®, use 4 drops! Don't pull the chocolate out of the freezer until you need to fill the center. The chocolate melts very quickly at room temperature.

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |

| 349 | 7 | 18 | undefined | 52 |

## Ingredients

- 1120g chicken breast
- 60g all-purpose flour
- 1 egg
- 140g Italian-style breadcrumbs
- 235g Frank's RedHot® sauce

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. Cut chicken breasts into 1-2" thick strips.
3. Set up dredging station with 3 containers. Meal prep containers work best in this instance.
4. Put flour in first container, an egg in the second, and breadcrumbs in the third.
5. Beat egg with a whisk until smooth.
6. Lay one strip at a time in the flour and thoroughly cover. Make sure to get flour into all of the crevices of the chicken to ensure full coverage.
7. Put the chicken strip in the egg wash, making sure it is thoroughly coated. Let excess egg wash drip off of the chicken before transferring to the breadcrumb station.
8. Lay the chicken on top of the breadcrumbs, pick up the container and start shaking it back and forth to fully coat the chicken strip.
9. Once coated, cover with additional breadcrumbs and push them into the chicken and its crevices to make sure full coverage is achieved.
10. Place the breaded chicken strip on a sheet pan with a baking rack and repeat until all chicken strips are finished.
11. Bake chicken strips in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until internal temperature has reached 165°F.
12. Separate into five even servings. When you are ready to eat, add one serving to a bowl with 45g hot sauce, and toss.
13. Reheat in the oven or air fryer for 3-4 minutes at 350°F and coat with hot sauce right before serving.

## Tips

Bake your chicken strips in an air fryer at 400°F for 6-8 minutes to cook your tenders faster and make them crispier. Use a sauce brush to coat the tenders with hot sauce for a more even coat and no risk of the breading coming off.

# JALAPEÑO POPPER GRILLED CHEESE

**Serves:** 1 | **Prep:** 15 MINS | **Cook:** 10 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 412 | 17 | 35 | undefined | 33 |

## Ingredients

- 8g green onion, chopped
- 28g reduced-fat cheddar cheese
- 28g pepper jack cheese
- 28g fat-free cheddar cheese
- 50g fat-free cream cheese
- Dash black pepper
- 1g salt
- 50g jalapeños, diced
- 4g garlic, minced
- 2 slices of bread (35 Cal)
- Spray oil

## Directions

1. Thinly slice green onions, shred cheese, and add to a medium-sized bowl. Add the cream cheese, black pepper, and salt.
2. Dice the jalapeños and add to a preheated pan on medium heat until blistering.
3. Once the jalapeños blister, use a garlic press to mince garlic into the middle of the pan. Cook until fragrant, then add mixture to the bowl with the cheeses.
4. Mix everything in the bowl until thoroughly combined.
5. Using the same pan and keeping the heat on medium, lightly spray pan with oil and add bread to pan. Lightly spray the top of bread with oil as well.
6. Once browning starts to occur on the bottom side of the bread, flip it over and add the cheese mixture to one of the slices of bread.
7. Take the other slice of bread and place the toasted side onto the cheese mixture. Once the bottom slice of bread is toasted, flip over to toast the other side.
8. Once finished, put in microwave for 15-20 seconds or until cheese starts melting down the sides.

## Tips

If bread is too soft after the microwave, put back on the pan for 1-2 minutes per side to crisp back up.

## Notes

If you're concerned about spice levels, remove the seeds from the jalapeño to reduce the spiciness. Due to thickness of this grilled cheese, if you want a truly melty consistency this step is an absolute must.

# $1 BURRITO MEAL PREP

**Serves:** 5 | **Prep:** 20 MINS | **Cook:** 3 HRS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 259 | 9 | 25 | 8 | 23 |

## Ingredients

- 9" tortilla (200 cal)
- 160g refried beans
- 30g fat-free cheddar cheese, shredded
- 30g 2% sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
- Oil spray

## Directions

1. Make Refried Beans. A pinch of smoked paprika was added to the beans for this recipe. Your final beans should be much thicker than if you were eating them as a side dish, so they hold up better in the burrito.
2. Once beans have cooled, add beans and cheese to the middle of each tortilla. Wrap into burritos.
3. Lightly spray a preheated pan or griddle on medium heat with oil and add each burrito folded side down. Lightly press down on each burrito to ensure even browning and to help them seal.
4. After 30 seconds or browned to your preference, lightly spray the top of each burrito with oil and flip onto the other side. Again, lightly press down on each burrito and allow to brown for 30 seconds.
5. Let burritos cool and store in the fridge for up to a week or place in a vacuum sealed bag in the freezer.
6. If refrigerated, wrap burrito in parchment paper and microwave for 60-90 seconds. The same applies if frozen, but heat up 3-4 minutes or until cooked through. You can also heat a burrito up in a preheated 400° oven for 6-10 minutes if refrigerated or 16-20 minutes if frozen.

# $1 NEAPOLITAN PIZZA

**Serves:** 5 | **Prep:** 24 HR | **Cook:** 10 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 608 | 12 | 84 | undefined | 37 |

## Ingredients

### DRY

- 475g all-purpose flour
- 100g vital wheat gluten
- 12.5g salt
- 4g instant yeast

### WET

- 425g water

### TOPPINGS

- 300g fresh mozzarella
- 350g 6 in 1 ground tomatoes

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, whisk the dry ingredients together. Add water and mix with a spoon until a shaggy dough forms.
2. Use a wet hand to press and fold the dough until fully combined and no dry parts remain. Cover and rest for 20 minutes.
3. With a wet hand, pull one side of the dough up as high as possible and fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl 90°, repeating 3-4 times. Flip the dough, form a ball, and cover for another 20 minutes.
4. Repeat step 3.
5. Divide the dough into 5 pieces, each about 200g.
6. Flatten each piece, fold the edges into the center, flip, and shape into a ball by pulling it toward yourself. Rotate 90° and repeat until smooth.
7. Place each dough ball in a vacuum-sealed bag and refrigerate for 24 hours.
8. After refrigeration, re-seal each bag to remove any air caused by the yeast, then freeze.
9. Portion five servings of 60g cheese, pat dry with a paper towel, and vacuum seal with slight separation between pieces. Divide sauce into five 70g portions and transfer to containers. Freeze both.
10. 2-3 hours before baking, place a dough ball, sauce, and cheese on the counter to defrost. Transfer the cheese to a small bowl to manage condensation.
11. Lightly flour your surface and carefully remove the dough from the vac seal. Place it on the floured surface and dust the top with flour.
12. Outline the crust with your fingers. Press outward from the center of the dough until it is about 6 inches wide. If sticking occurs, add more flour and continue stretching.
13. Lift the dough (avoiding the crust) and stretch it with your fists in a circular motion until 9-11 inches wide.
14. Place the stretched dough on parchment paper and top with tomatoes.
15. Bake on a preheated pizza steel at 550°F for 4-5 minutes. Remove, pat mozzarella dry with paper towel, and add to the pizza. Bake for an additional 2-3 minutes.

## Tips

You can use regular freezer bags to store the dough. Just keep in mind, it will get freezer burn and lose flavor faster.

# $1 PAN PIZZA

**Serves:** 5 | **Prep:** 1 HR | **Cook:** 13 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 651 | 14 | 91 | undefined | 40 |

## Ingredients

### DOUGH

- 500g all-purpose flour
- 100g vital wheat gluten
- 10g salt
- 5g instant yeast
- 440g water

### SAUCE

- 28oz can Cento® crushed tomatoes
- 1.5g garlic powder
- 6g salt, or to taste

### PIZZA BUILD

- Oil spray
- 1 Dough
- 80g Sauce
- 60g part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded

## Directions

1. Place flour, vital wheat gluten, yeast, and salt into a food processor and process for 30 seconds.
2. Turn processor on high, slowly mix in water over a 30-60 second period, and let dough mixture process for an additional 30-60 seconds.
3. Plop dough onto the counter, roll it into a ball, and divide the dough into 5 pieces. Each piece should weigh roughly 200-210g.
4. Form each dough into individual balls by flattening the dough with your fingers, folding each side of the dough into the middle, flipping it over, and rolling it in a circular motion until a ball is formed.
5. Grab 5 high sided containers, lightly spray oil into each one, put one dough ball into each container, spray the top of the dough ball, cover with a lid, and put any dough that will not be used in the next hour or two in the fridge.
6. In a separate high-sided container, add the can of tomatoes, garlic powder, and salt. Stir to combine, cover with a lid, and refrigerate.
7. Spray oil onto your hands and an oven safe pan, plop dough into the middle, start stretching it towards the corners of the pan, and spread it to your desired size and thickness. If the dough keeps snapping back, cover it for 15 minutes, then come back and finish stretching. This gives the dough time to relax.
8. Add sauce and spread evenly over the dough with the back of a spoon. Top with mozzarella cheese and bake in a preheated 425°F oven for 12-14 minutes or until cheese is golden brown.
9. Using a spatula, check the bottom of the pizza to make sure it is golden brown as well. If it isn't, you can put it on the stovetop on medium heat and check it every minute or two until it is cooked to your preference.

## Tips

Dough can be stored in the fridge up to a week and actually develops MORE flavor over time. You can store any unused dough by spreading it out in a lightly oiled gallon bag, freezing it, and removing it an hour before they need to be used.

### FRENCH FRIES

- 1000g russet potatoes, peeled (about 1200g before peeling)
- 1200g beef broth
- 30g sugar
- 8g oil spray
- Salt, to taste

## Directions

1. Add beef broth and sugar to a large bowl and whisk until sugar is dissolved.
2. Peel potatoes and using a fry tower cutter, cut the potatoes into shoestring french fry size and add to beef broth mixture.
3. Once all fries are added to the beef broth, mix fries around to keep them separated. Make sure all fries are covered with broth and set to the side.
4. Preheat an air fryer to 400°F.
5. Cut chicken breast into medium-sized chunks, add to blender, and pulse blender for 10-15 seconds or until it is a similar consistency to ground chicken.
6. Add ground chicken to a bowl, then add salt and erythritol. Mix together until ingredients are thoroughly combined.
7. Spray your hands with oil to prevent the ground chicken from sticking to your hands, then separate the chicken mix into 140g sized balls. Form the chicken balls into patties that are slightly wider than the buns and place on a piece of parchment paper.
8. Set up dredging stations by adding all ingredients to three separate containers and mixing until well combined.
9. With one hand or your "wet hand," take a chicken patty, submerge it into the first wet station container, let extra liquid drip off, and place into the Dry Ingredients container.
10. Using your other hand or what I like to call your "dry hand," add the wet patty to your dry flour mixture and push flour into the patty to coat it thoroughly, making sure the sides of the patty are covered as well.
11. Once patty is fully coated, shake any excess flour off, and add to Wet Station Two.
12. Make sure the chicken patty is completely coated in egg wash and let any excess drip off.
13. Put chicken patty back into the dry station and repeat step 10.
14. Place the finished chicken patty on wire rack and repeat.
15. Spray the bottom of the air fryer and place a patty into the air fryer basket, spraying a light coat of oil on the top of the patty.
16. Cook chicken for 6-8 minutes in the air fryer or until chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165°F, flipping halfway through.
17. Repeat until all chicken is cooked.
18. While patties are cooking, drain broth out of the fries, and add fries to a salad spinner.
19. Use salad spinner to get excess liquid off of the fries and place them onto paper towels.
20. Using paper towels, pat the fries dry and once the final NickChicken is finished, lightly spray the bottom of the air fryer with oil.
21. Add a layer of fries to the air fryer, lightly spray the top of the fries with oil, and repeat layering/oil combination until all fries are added.
22. Cook at 400°F for 20-25 minutes, tossing every 5-6 minutes.
23. Take fries out, add salt to taste, and shake them to evenly disperse salt.
24. Thinly slice lettuce, add light mayo to condiment cups, lay out 5 meal prep containers, and let NickChickens and fries come to room temperature.
25. Add NickChicken, fries, lettuce, and mayo to each meal prep container and refrigerate.
26. When ready to chow down, toast the inside of a bun, place fries and NickChicken in a preheated 350°F air fryer for 3-4 minutes, plate it, and eat.

| 585 | 17 | 69 | undefined | 41 |

## Ingredients

### DOUGH

- 405g all-purpose flour
- 5g salt
- 3g instant yeast
- 250g water

### SAUCE

- 10g olive oil
- 80g onion, grated
- 7g garlic
- 1g dried oregano
- 794g Red Gold® crushed tomatoes
- 5g salt

### POT PIE BUILD

- 1 dough
- 65g part-skim mozzarella, sliced
- 40g fat-free mozzarella, shredded
- 65g sauce
- 3g butter, melted
- Oil spray

## Directions

1. Add flour, salt, and yeast to a large bowl. Whisk to combine.
2. Add water and mix the ingredients using a spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Go in with a wet hand, press the dough down, and fold it onto itself. The goal is to get all of the dry ingredients mixed in.
3. Once the dough is fully hydrated, cover for 20 minutes.
4. Using a wet hand, perform a stretch and fold by pulling one side of the dough as high as possible then folding it over itself.
5. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and repeat 3-4 more times until all dough has been stretched.
6. Flip the dough over and form into a ball by sliding your hand underneath the dough and pulling it in a circular motion towards your body.
7. Cover the dough for 20 minutes and repeat steps 4-6. Cover for an additional 20 minutes.
8. Divide the dough into 5 pieces. Each piece should weigh roughly 130g.
9. Form each piece into individual balls by flattening the dough with your fingers, folding each side of the dough into the middle, flipping it over, and rolling it in a circular motion until a ball is formed.
10. Grab 5 high-sided containers, lightly spray oil into each one, put a dough ball into each container, cover with a lid, and refrigerate for 24 hours.
11. Add olive oil and onion to a preheated pot on medium heat and mix. Sauté onion for 2-3 minutes, add garlic and oregano, and stir.
12. Once garlic becomes fragrant, add tomatoes and salt. Stir to combine. When the sauce starts bubbling or boiling, reduce the heat to low, give the pot a mix, and simmer for 15-20 minutes.
13. After cooling, transfer the sauce to a high-sided container and refrigerate.
14. Grab a ceramic bowl that is about 6" wide and 1.5" deep. Lightly spray with oil.
15. Add slices of mozzarella to the bowl, followed by the fat-free mozzarella and sauce.
16. Grab the outside of the dough and rotate it in a circle, letting gravity stretch it out until it is big enough to cover the entire bowl.
17. Lay the dough over the top of the bowl and pat the edges of the dough.
18. Heat butter in the microwave until melted. Lightly brush it on the top and sides of the dough.
19. Bake in a preheated 450°F oven for 14-16 minutes or until dough is golden brown.
20. Once finished pull it out, heat 3g of butter in the microwave until melted, and brush on top.
21. With high quality oven mitts, quickly flip the bowl on a tray lined with aluminum foil. Slowly go around the rim with a spoon and pull the bowl away from the pot pie.
22. Brush any remaining butter on top of the crust and place under the broiler on high until the cheese and crust turn golden brown or to your preference.

## Tips

You can make multiple pot pies at once and freeze them. To reheat, bake at 450°F for 12-16 minutes.

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 346 | 15 | 34 | 23 | 29 |

## Ingredients

### SAUSAGE

- 448g 90% lean ground pork
- 6g salt
- 2g MSG
- 2g black pepper
- 1.5g sage
- 1.5g rosemary
- 1g garlic powder
- 1g onion powder
- .5g nutmeg
- 2.5g potato starch
- 20g erythritol

### SANDWICH [1 SERVING]

- 1 English muffin (100 cal)
- 1 slice Velveeta cheese
- 1 egg
- 1 sausage patty

## Directions

1. Combine sausage ingredients in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 12-24 hours for best flavor.
2. Divide sausage into 80g portions, roll into balls, and place each on a sheet of parchment paper. Cover with another sheet, and press into 5" patties using a flat-bottomed pan or pot.
3. Heat a pan over medium heat and cook the patties for 2-3 minutes on one side, until browned.
4. Flip the patties and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.
5. Wipe the pan clean. Spray six CANNING LIDS AND BANDS with oil for easy release, and place them in the pan.
6. Crack an egg into each break the yolk, top with salt, and add 30g water to the pan. Cover immediately and cook 2-3 minutes.
7. Let the sausage and eggs cool completely, then pat dry with a paper towel to prevent soggy sandwiches.
8. Assemble the sandwiches by layering the bottom bun, cheese, an egg, a sausage patty, and the top bun. Optional: Toast muffins in the pan before assembling if desired. However, I find with condensation when reheating, it's not worth the extra step.

## Tips

If you can't get 90% lean ground pork, use ground beef or turkey with similar macros.

## Notes

Storage: Freezing: Freeze assembled sandwiches on a sheet pan for 2 hours, then vacuum seal or store in airtight bags. Refrigerating: Wrap sandwiches in parchment paper and refrigerate. Reheating: From frozen: Wrap in parchment paper, thaw overnight in the fridge (10-12 hours), then microwave 60-90 seconds. From fridge: Microwave 60-90 seconds.

## Ingredients

- 28oz can Cento San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes
- 66g tomato paste
- 8g extra virgin olive oil
- 7g garlic, minced
- 2.3g onion powder
- 1g dried oregano
- 1g crushed red pepper flakes
- 6g salt, or to taste
- 10g granulated erythritol, or to taste

If you want a chunkier sauce, crush tomatoes by hand and mix all ingredients with a whisk or spatula instead of an immersion blender. If you want a zero stash up marinara, pour and mix ingredients directly in the container they will be stored in.

# NICKDONALD'S SWEET & SOUR SAUCE

**Serves:** 12 | **Prep:** 5 MINS | **Cook:** 8 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 10 | 0 | 9 | 3 | 0 |

## Ingredients

- 85g sugar free peach preserves
- 85g sugar free apricot preserves
- 100g water
- 30g white vinegar
- 50g erythritol
- 10g soy sauce
- 5g mustard
- 2g cornstarch
- 1g salt
- 1g garlic powder
- .5g onion powder

## Directions

1. Place all ingredients in a high-sided container and emulsify for 30 seconds using an immersion blender.
2. If whisking by hand, first dissolve the cornstarch in the water, then add to the high-sided container with the remaining ingredients and mix well.
3. Transfer the mixture to a pot and place over medium heat.
4. Cook for 6-8 minutes, or until the sauce reaches 180°F. This activates the cornstarch and allows the sauce to thicken as it cools.
5. Remove from heat, stir, and allow the sauce to cool to room temperature.
6. Add sauce to a container and refrigerate.

## Tips

You may substitute 50g allulose syrup for erythritol. The flavor will be slightly different, but both work very well. If only one flavor of sugar-free preserves is available to you, double up and use 170g instead of 85g. The sauce will still taste excellent.

# BLT DIP

**Serves:** 13 | **Prep:** 10 MINS | **Cook:** 10 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 78 | 5 | 2 | undefined | 8 |

## Ingredients

- 108g center cut bacon (1 package), chopped
- 450g 0% greek yogurt
- 100g low-fat cream cheese
- 150g tomatoes, chopped

## Directions

1. Let the cream cheese sit at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours before starting this recipe. This will make it MUCH easier to mix into the dip.
2. Arrange the bacon strips evenly on a sheet pan and place in a preheated 450°F oven for 10-14 minutes, or until they reach your preferred level of crispiness.
3. Slice the tomato in half, remove the seeds with a spoon, and then dice the tomato into small, uniform pieces.
4. Add tomato, cream cheese, and greek yogurt to a bowl.
5. Place the cooked bacon on a cutting board, chop into bite-sized pieces, and add to the bowl.
6. Mix all the ingredients together to combine.
7. Enjoy right away or place in the fridge and allow to sit for 24 hours for maximum flavor.

## Tips

I prefer to spend the extra couple minutes cooking fresh bacon to my preferred doneness. However, when short on time, real bacon bits are a great alternative.

# BUFFALO CHICKEN DIP

**Serves:** 4 | **Prep:** 25 MINS | **Cook:** 25 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 546 | 18 | 16 | undefined | 82 |

## Ingredients

### DIP

- 1 rotisserie chicken, meat only
- 224g fat-free cream cheese
- 170g 2% greek yogurt
- 224g cottage cheese
- 210g Frank's buffalo sauce
- 2g onion powder
- 2g garlic powder
- 1g dried parsley
- .5g dried dill
- 84g 2% cheddar, shredded
- 84g fat-free cheddar, shredded
- 25g green onion, sliced
- 5 pepperoncinis, sliced

### TOPPING

- 42g pork rinds
- 14g Parmigiano-Reggiano
- 10g buffalo sauce
- 17.5g light ranch
- 4.5g green onion, diced

## Directions

1. Let the cream cheese sit at room temp for 1-2 hours until softened.
2. Remove the meat from the chicken, add it to a bowl, and shred it into bite-sized chunks. You can use 626g canned chicken here, but it'll bring the flavor down 3-4 notches (aka significantly).
3. Mix in the softened cream cheese.
4. Into a high-sided container, combine Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, 30g buffalo sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, parsley, and dill. Blend with an immersion blender until smooth.
5. Pour the blended mixture into the bowl along with the remaining buffalo sauce, cheddar cheese, chopped green onion (use the white/lighter parts), and pepperoncinis. Mix everything well.
6. Spread evenly into an 8"x8" pan.
7. Using a blender cup, mix pork rinds until a crumb-like texture forms. Combine with parmesan, then sprinkle over the top.
8. Bake in a preheated 375°F oven for 25-30 minutes.
9. Finish with buffalo sauce, ranch, and more green onion (the green part).
10. Slice into 4 squares, dig in, and watch the muscle pile on.

## Tips

During my five rotisserie chicken tests, I averaged 360g breast meat, 150g thigh meat, 73g drumstick meat, and 43g wing meat. I used these numbers to calculate the final calories and macros for this dish. For the best accuracy, place the bowl on a scale during step 2 and measure the amount of meat you get from each section. If you can't get fat-free cream cheese, replace with an additional 224g 2% cottage cheese.

# CRISPY ROASTED POTATOES

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 218 | 4 | 43 | undefined | 5 |

## Ingredients

- 2000g water
- 30g salt
- 6g baking soda
- 1200g Yukon gold potatoes
- 20g olive oil
- 8g garlic, minced
- 2g fresh oregano, chopped
- 2g salt
- 1g black pepper
- 3g fresh parsley, chopped

## Directions

1. Place a sheet pan in the oven and preheat to 450°F.
2. In a large pot, add water, salt, and baking soda, stirring until dissolved. Place on the stovetop over high heat.
3. Set a small pan on medium heat next to the pot.
4. Cut each potato into 4-6 pieces depending on size. Each piece should be around 2-3".
5. Add potatoes to the boiling pot, stir, and boil for 10 minutes.
6. While the potatoes boil, add oil and oregano to the small pan. After 30-60 seconds, add the garlic and a pinch of salt, and stir.
7. Once the garlic turns golden brown, strain the oil over a large bowl and set the strainer aside.
8. Using a colander, strain the potatoes and let them steam for 4-5 minutes.
9. Add potatoes to the bowl of oil, season with salt and pepper, and toss to combine.
10. Be a bit rough with the potatoes. They should look slightly battered, which will help create an amazingly crispy crust.
11. Carefully remove the sheet pan from oven, pour the potatoes onto it, and spread them out evenly. Ensure the flesh of the potato, not the skin, is touching the pan.
12. Throw the potatoes in the oven for 25-30 minutes.
13. Carefully flip the potatoes so that another part of the flesh is touching the sheet pan. Return to the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until deeply golden brown.
14. Transfer the finished potatoes to a bowl, add the fried garlic and oregano, and toss. Top with parsley and salt to taste.
15. Take a bite and listen to the unbelievable crunch. Each serving should weigh about 115 grams.
16. To reheat, simply add them to a preheated 400°F air fryer for 3-4 minutes.

# MAC AND CHEESE EGG ROLLS

**Serves:** 4 | **Prep:** 1.5 HRS | **Cook:** 30 MINS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 271 | 3 | 42 | undefined | 21 |

## Ingredients

- 126g Banza® Noodles
- 4g salt
- Dash black pepper

### CHEESE MIX

- 4 slices fat-free American cheese
- 2 slices sharp cheddar Velveeta®
- 56g fat-free cheddar cheese
- 60g fat-free milk
- 4g garlic, minced
- Dash onion powder

### EGG ROLL BUILD

- 4 egg roll wraps (80 cal per wrap)
- 1 egg white
- Oil spray (4 seconds total)

## Directions

1. Add noodles and salt to boiling water and cook per label instructions, stirring occasionally so noodles do not stick to the bottom of the pot.
2. Drain noodles and save some of the pasta water for later.
3. Add noodles back to pot, put pot back on stovetop, and set burner to low.
4. Add all Cheese Mix ingredients and stir to combine. If necessary, add a spoonful or two of pasta water to successfully melt everything together. The goal is to have a thick mac and cheese so that the egg rolls fry up perfectly in the air fryer without leaking.
5. Separate egg white from the egg yolk into a small bowl and whisk until smooth.
6. Put 4 egg roll wraps on counter and using a brush, spread egg white on outer edges of the wrap. Add mac and cheese as evenly as possible across the center of each wrap.
7. Take the corner of the egg roll and wrap it over the mac and cheese. Try and tuck the triangle portion of the wrap into/under the mac and cheese.
8. Add more egg white to the corners of the wrap and fold in.
9. Add a little more egg white to the tip of the wrap and finish rolling. Make sure egg roll is fully sealed and repeat.
10. Place egg rolls on lightly oiled parchment paper and freeze for one hour. You can cook these right away, but I have found it to be better after freezing.
11. Add egg white to the entire outside of egg rolls, then add to a preheated 400°F air fryer fold side down and spray the top with oil for one second per egg roll.
12. After 3 minutes, flip egg rolls and spray each one with oil for an additional second.
13. Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, get some low-calorie ranch and ENJOY.

## Tips

Make double the egg rolls, pull them from the freezer, and air fry whenever you need a quick snack or meal. Use these as an appetizer or as a side to another low-calorie entrée.

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 172 | 2 | 38 | N/A | 4 |

## Ingredients

- 1000g russet potatoes, peeled (about ~1200g before peeling)
- 1200g beef broth
- 30g sugar
- 8g oil spray
- Salt, to taste

## Directions

1. Add beef broth and sugar into a large bowl and whisk to combine.
2. Peel potatoes and, using a fry tower cutter, cut the potatoes into shoestring french fry size and add to beef broth mixture. Can also cut the fries by hand into 1/4" x 1/4" pieces to replicate the slim profile of a NickDonalds french fry.
3. Once all fries are added to the beef broth, mix fries around to keep them separated. Make sure all fries are covered with broth and let them marinade for 30 minutes.
4. Drain liquid out of bowl and dry the fries using a salad spinner and/or paper towels.
5. Add a layer of fries to a preheated 400°F air fryer, lightly spray the top of the fries with oil, and repeat layering/oil combination until all fries are added.
6. Cook for 20-25 minutes; tossing every 5-6 minutes. Every time the fries are shaken or tossed, lightly spray them with oil.
7. Take fries out, add salt to taste, and shake them to evenly disperse salt.
8. Split into 5 portions and store them for use as a side dish to other meals throughout the week.
9. To reheat, simply add them to a preheated 400°F air fryer for 3-4 minutes.

## Tips

Make sure you buy broth with ingredients that are as close to pure beef broth as possible. You want to avoid ones that include celery, carrot, onion, and/or garlic powder.

# TACO EGG ROLLS

## Macros

| Calories | Fat | Carbs | Net Carbs | Protein |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| 158 | 4 | 15 | undefined | 14 |

## Ingredients

### EGG ROLL FILLING (~505g total cooked weight)

- 5g avocado oil (ground beef)
- 448g 96% lean ground beef
- 6g MSG
- 5g avocado oil
- 130g onion, diced
- 5g garlic, minced
- 3g chili powder
- 3g cumin
- 3g coriander
- 3g smoked paprika
- 1g black pepper
- 60g tomato sauce
- 50g beef broth
- 3g salt

### EGG ROLL

- 1 egg roll wrap (60 cal)
- 14g fat-free cheddar cheese, shredded
- 35g Egg Roll Filling
- 30g oil (for frying)

## Directions

1. Add avocado oil to a preheated pan on medium heat and add ground beef to the pan by crumbling in bite-sized chunks.
2. Add MSG evenly across the beef, break down beef even more using a wooden spatula, and stir constantly until meat is cooked.
3. Set meat aside on a plate or into a container, wipe down pan, place back on the stovetop, and add avocado oil.
4. Add chili powder, cumin, coriander, smoked paprika, and black pepper to a small bowl and mix.
5. Add onions to pan, mix around so oil is spread evenly throughout, and cook 1-2 minutes or until onions become translucent.
6. Make room in the middle of the pan, add garlic, and stir. Make room in the middle of the pan again, add the seasoning mix, let it sit for 20-30 seconds, then add cooked meat into the pan. Mix well.
7. Once combined, add beef broth and tomato sauce, mix together, and turn burner to low to let the mixture simmer for about 10 minutes.
8. Once Egg Roll Filling has reduced, put on a plate, and let it cool for 10-15 minutes.
9. Into a 5" or 6" pan add oil and turn on medium heat.
10. Fill a small bowl with water and set aside. Lay an egg roll wrap on the counter.
11. Into the middle of the egg roll wrap, add cheese and filling, and pack together. Using a brush, dampen a ½-inch square with water on the edge of the wrap.
12. Bring one of the corners of the egg roll wrap over the filling, tuck the inside of the egg roll wrap into the filling, put water on the corners of the wrap, and fold the corners towards the middle. Brush water on the edges of the wrap and roll it up. Making sure the egg roll is tightly wrapped is important because if anything gets out, oil will splatter and it not only makes a mess, but it can burn you.
13. Bring oil in the pan to 375°F. Carefully lay the egg roll corner side down and flip after 2 minutes or when browned.
14. If the sides of the egg roll need to be fried, use tongs and lay egg roll on its side. Repeat for other side if necessary.

## Tips

If you want to use the egg roll filling for a different recipe, it works perfectly in the as well.

- 330g seedless watermelon
- 110g water
- 20g granulated erythritol
- 0.5g salt

## Directions

1. Wash and dry the outside of the watermelon and put it on the biggest cutting board you have.

3. Put half of the watermelon off to the side and the other half cut side down on the cutting board.
4. Cut where the pink meets the white (the rind) and try to follow that all the way down.
5. Go around the entire watermelon until there is no more rind remaining, but if a little rind remains, that is okay.

14. A perfect sorbet consistency has now been achieved and it is time to eat.

## Tips

TIP: Instead of blending every gram of watermelon, put some chunks in containers to have as a quick snack or great pre-workout meal.TIP: You can buy pre-cut fruit to make the first part of this process go much faster, but it will also be much more expensive to do so. In addition, after you cut and puree the watermelon you will have enough for 10+ sorbets, so it's worth putting the extra work in.

- 15g lime juice
- 50g water
- 5g salt

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 500°F, add a sheet pan into the oven, preheat 2 large pans on medium heat, and place a large bowl in the freezer.
2. Cut steak diagonally into thin strips and transfer them to a bowl. In the same bowl, add soy sauce, salt, black pepper, baking soda, and avocado oil. Massage these ingredients into the steak, ensuring they are well incorporated.
3. Slice the onions, bell peppers, and anaheim peppers into ¼ inch strips and add to a large bowl.
4. In a small bowl, combine cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Mix the ingredients together until well blended.
5. Sprinkle the seasonings over the sliced vegetables followed by lime juice and avocado oil. Using your hands, mix all the ingredients together until they are thoroughly combined and evenly coated.
6. Using oven mitts, grab the sheet pan from the oven, add the vegetables to the pan, and spread them out evenly using tongs. Place the sheet pan in the oven and set a timer for 10 minutes.
7. Increase the heat to medium-high on both pans. In one of the pans, add the tomatillos, onion, jalapeno, and serrano pepper. Flip the vegetables every few minutes to ensure they are evenly roasted.
8. Using the other pan, add 4 grams of avocado oil and half of the steak. Spread the steak evenly over the pan's surface and brown for 2-3 minutes. Toss the steak, continue cooking for an additional 1-2 minutes, and transfer to a large bowl.
9. Once the timer goes off, remove the sheet pan from the oven and using tongs, mix the vegetables around the pan. After the vegetables are evenly spread out, place the sheet pan back in the oven and set another timer for 10 minutes.
10. Finish cooking the remaining steak by repeating Step 8. Add the cooked steak to the bowl with the rest of the finished steak.
11. Add the roasted stovetop vegetables into a food processor along with ROASTED GARLIC, cilantro, lime juice, water, and salt. Blend the ingredients for 1-2 minutes.
12. Grab the bowl from the freezer, add the salsa to it, and place back into the freezer for 5-10 minutes.
13. Once the timer goes off, turn the broiler on high, mix the vegetables around the pan, and broil them for 2-3 minutes.
14. Add the roasted vegetables to the cooked steak and mix thoroughly.
15. Into a medium bowl, add tomato sauce, chicken bouillon, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, and oregano. Mix thoroughly.
16. Add chicken broth into a measuring cup and microwave for 1-2 minutes or until broth has reached 120°F.
17. Turn the pan that roasted the vegetables onto medium heat, add avocado oil and rice into the pan, and stir to combine. Frequently stir the mixture until the rice has become golden brown.
18. Add the tomato sauce into the pan, stir to combine, and cook for 30 seconds.
19. Add the chicken broth and stir to combine. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low, cover with a lid, and cook for 12 minutes.
20. Keeping the lid on, move the pan off the heat, let it sit for 15 minutes, and stir to combine.
21. To assemble, distribute the steak fajita mix and mexican rice evenly among 5 meal prep containers. Fill 2 oz plastic cups with salsa verde, cover each container with a lid, and refrigerate.
22. When it's time to eat, place a wet paper towel over the meal prep containers and microwave them in 60-second intervals until they are heated through. For more even cooking, mix the ingredients between each interval.
