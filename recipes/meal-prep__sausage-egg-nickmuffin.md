## Ingredients

### SAUSAGE

- 448g 90% lean ground pork
- 6g salt
- 2g MSG
- 2g black pepper
- 1.5g sage
- 1.5g rosemary
- 1g garlic powder
- 1g onion powder
- .5g nutmeg
- 2.5g potato starch
- 20g erythritol

### SANDWICH (1 SERVING)

- 1 English muffin (100 cal)
- 1 slice Velveeta® cheese
- 1 egg
- 1 sausage patty

## Directions

1. Combine sausage ingredients in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 12-24 hours for best flavor.
2. Divide sausage into 80g portions, roll into balls, and place each on a sheet of parchment paper. Cover with another sheet, and press into 5" patties using a flat-bottomed pan or pot.
3. Heat a pan over medium heat and cook the patties for 2-3 minutes on one side, until browned.
4. Flip the patties and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.
5. Wipe the pan clean. Spray six CANNING LIDS AND BANDS with oil for easy release, and place them in the pan.
6. Crack an egg into each, break the yolk, top with salt, and add 30g water to the pan. Cover immediately and cook 2-3 minutes.
7. Let the sausage and eggs cool completely, then pat dry with a paper towel to prevent soggy sandwiches.
8. Assemble the sandwiches by layering the bottom bun, cheese, an egg, a sausage patty, and the top bun. Optional: Toast muffins in the pan before assembling if desired. However, I find with condensation when reheating, it's not worth the extra step.
9. Storage: Freezing: Freeze assembled sandwiches on a sheet pan for 2 hours, then vacuum seal or store in airtight bags. Refrigerating: Wrap sandwiches in parchment paper and refrigerate.
10. Reheating: From frozen: Wrap in parchment paper, thaw overnight in the fridge (10-12 hours), then microwave 60-90 seconds. From fridge: Microwave 60-90 seconds.

## Tips

If you can't get 90% lean ground pork, use ground beef or turkey with similar macros.
