## Tips

For an even better eating experience, after step 7, line a large glass with the sea salt caramel. Then sprinkle some of the Mix-ins into the glass which will stick directly onto the caramel. Pour the ice cream into your glass, top with remaining caramel and Mix-ins, and continually get bites filled with caramel, Oreo®, and brownie as you eat your way down the glass.
