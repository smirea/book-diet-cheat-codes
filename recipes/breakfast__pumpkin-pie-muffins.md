## Ingredients

### WET

- 120g banana
- 240g pure pumpkin
- 2 eggs
- 21g avocado oil
- 4.2g vanilla extract
- 40g brown sugar erythritol (add 20g if using PEScience Multipurpose protein powder)
- 40g granulated erythritol (add 20g if using PEScience Multipurpose protein powder)

### DRY

- 90g all-purpose flour
- 93g PEScience Pumpkin Pie protein powder (90g PEScience Multipurpose protein powder if sold out)
- 5g pumpkin spice (6g if using PEScience Multipurpose protein powder)
- 7g ground cinnamon
- 3g salt
- 4g baking powder
- 2g baking soda

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, add bananas and break them down using a fork or an immersion blender.
2. In a large bowl, add the Wet Ingredients and whisk to combine.
3. In another large bowl, add the Dry Ingredients and whisk to combine.
4. Add Dry Ingredients into the bowl of the Wet Ingredients and whisk until just BARELY combined 
 overmixing will result in chewy muffins. To make sure everything is combined, fold the mixture 3-4 times and scrape the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula.
5. Line 13 muffin liners on a sheet pan, add 59g of muffin mix to each liner, and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 16-18 minutes. You know they are done when a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin has some crumbs sticking to it, but nothing wet.
6. Store muffins in a paper towel lined air-tight container or simply throw them in a plastic bag and enjoy for the next 3-4 days.

## Tips

If you want a moister muffin, pull them about one minute before they are done. They will be slightly underdone, but it'll make them so much more flavorful in my opinion.
