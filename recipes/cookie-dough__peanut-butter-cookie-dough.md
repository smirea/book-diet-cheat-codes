## Ingredients

### DRY

- 60g all-purpose flour
- 40g powdered peanut butter
- 65g PEScience Peanut Butter Cookie protein powder

### WET

- 30g peanut butter
- 14g unsalted butter
- 2 eggs

- 4.2g vanilla extract
- 28g granulated erythritol

## Directions

1. Add flour to large bowl and heat it up in the microwave in ten second intervals until it reaches 155°F.
2. Add the rest of the Dry Ingredients to the bowl and whisk thoroughly.
3. In a separate large bowl, microwave butter in ten second intervals until melted.
4. Add the rest of the Wet Ingredients over the butter and whisk until combined.
5. Add the Dry Ingredients to the Wet Ingredients in 3-4 parts and combine using a whisk. Once one part is fully mixed in, add another, and repeat until finished. When mixture becomes too thick for the whisk, switch to a spatula.
