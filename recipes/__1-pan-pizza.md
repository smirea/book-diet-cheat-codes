## Ingredients

### DOUGH

- 500g all-purpose flour
- 100g vital wheat gluten
- 10g salt
- 5g instant yeast
- 440g water

### SAUCE

- 28oz can Cento® crushed tomatoes
- 1.5g garlic powder
- 6g salt, or to taste

### PIZZA BUILD

- Oil spray
- 1 Dough
- 80g Sauce
- 60g part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded

## Directions

1. Place flour, vital wheat gluten, yeast, and salt into a food processor and process for 30 seconds.
2. Turn processor on high, slowly mix in water over a 30-60 second period, and let dough mixture process for an additional 30-60 seconds.
3. Plop dough onto the counter, roll it into a ball, and divide the dough into 5 pieces. Each piece should weigh roughly 200-210g.
4. Form each dough into individual balls by flattening the dough with your fingers, folding each side of the dough into the middle, flipping it over, and rolling it in a circular motion until a ball is formed.
5. Grab 5 high sided containers, lightly spray oil into each one, put one dough ball into each container, spray the top of the dough ball, cover with a lid, and put any dough that will not be used in the next hour or two in the fridge.
6. In a separate high-sided container, add the can of tomatoes, garlic powder, and salt. Stir to combine, cover with a lid, and refrigerate.
7. Spray oil onto your hands and an oven safe pan, plop dough into the middle, start stretching it towards the corners of the pan, and spread it to your desired size and thickness. If the dough keeps snapping back, cover it for 15 minutes, then come back and finish stretching. This gives the dough time to relax.
8. Add sauce and spread evenly over the dough with the back of a spoon. Top with mozzarella cheese and bake in a preheated 425°F oven for 12-14 minutes or until cheese is golden brown.
9. Using a spatula, check the bottom of the pizza to make sure it is golden brown as well. If it isn't, you can put it on the stovetop on medium heat and check it every minute or two until it is cooked to your preference.

## Tips

Dough can be stored in the fridge up to a week and actually develops MORE flavor over time. You can store any unused dough by spreading it out in a lightly oiled gallon bag, freezing it, and removing it about an hour before they need to be used.
