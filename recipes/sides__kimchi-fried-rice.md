## Ingredients

- 1 egg, sunny side up
- 10oz bag cauliflower rice, frozen

## Directions

1. Lightly spray a small pan with oil, add an egg, cover the pan, and turn on low.
2. Cook cauliflower rice in the microwave for the time recommended on the bag. While cooking, prep all other ingredients by adding them into separate bowls.

4. Add avocado oil and bacon in preheated high-sided pan on medium heat, stir to combine, and let them cook for two minutes.
5. Add green onions, stir to combine, and fry for 60 seconds.
6. Add the garlic and stir for 30 seconds.
7. Once garlic becomes fragrant, add cauliflower rice, stir to combine, and cook for one minute.
8. Add Bowl 4 to the pan, stir to combine, and let all those flavors mingle together for 1-2 minutes.
9. Plate it and eat it.
