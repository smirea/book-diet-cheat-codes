## Ingredients

- 224g pecans

### DRY

- 50g granulated erythritol
- 50g brown sugar erythritol
- 6g ground cinnamon
- 3g salt

### WET

- 1 egg white
- 4.2g vanilla extract
- 2g water

## Directions

1. Add DRY ingredients into a medium-sized bowl and whisk together.
2. In a separate medium-sized bowl, separate an egg white from the yolk and whisk the white for 60 seconds or until it becomes frothy.
3. Add vanilla extract and water to the frothed egg white and whisk until combined.
4. Add ⅓ dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until combined. Repeat with ⅓ of the dry ingredients at a time until dry ingredients are fully mixed in.
5. Pour pecans into the bowl and using a spatula, mix ingredients together until all pecans are fully coated.
6. Spread pecans into one even layer on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.
7. Bake in a preheated oven at 300°F for 30 minutes, mixing the pecans halfway through the baking process.
8. Let cool for one hour and store in an airtight container.

## Tips

If you want a lighter roast, turn oven temperature down to 250°F and cook for the same amount of time.
