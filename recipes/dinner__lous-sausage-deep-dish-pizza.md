## Ingredients

### DRY

- 190g all-purpose flour
- 40g vital wheat gluten
- 20g corn meal
- 6g sugar
- 4g salt
- 3g instant yeast

### WET

- 28g unsalted butter
- 160g water

### SAUCE

- 100g white onion, grated
- 15g garlic, minced
- 10g extra virgin olive oil
- 28oz can Cento San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes
- 66g tomato paste
- 1g oregano
- 4g salt
- 10g granulated erythritol

### PIZZA BUILD

- 7g extra virgin olive oil
- 1 Dough
- 224g whole milk low moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 224g fat-free mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 126g turkey pepperoni
- Sauce
- Optional: grated parmesan cheese

## Directions

1. Place Dry Ingredients into a food processor, process for 30 seconds, add butter to processor, and blend for an additional 20 seconds or until mixture becomes pebbly-looking.
2. Turn the processor on high while slowly adding the water over a 30 second period and let dough mixture process for an additional 20-30 seconds.
3. Flip the dough onto work surface, shape it into a ball, and place it in a lightly oiled medium-sized bowl. Spray the top of the dough with oil and cover for 60 minutes.
4. Grate 100g of onion on a box grater and drain any extra liquid.
5. Add olive oil, onion, and garlic to a preheated pot on medium heat, stir to combine, and let them cook for a few minutes while stirring occasionally.
6. Once the ingredients start to take on some color, add tomato paste and incorporate it into the mixture.
7. Using your hands, crush one tomato at a time in-between your fingers to your preferred chunkiness. If any tomatoes are too chunky, simply grab them out of the pan and crush them again.
8. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients to the pot and stir to combine. Once the sauce comes to a simmer, turn stovetop to low, cover with a lid that lets steam escape, and let it reduce for 20-30 minutes.
9. After the dough has risen for 60 minutes, refrigerate it for an additional 30 minutes.
10. Lightly dust work surface with flour, plop the dough down, lightly dust the dough and rolling pin with flour, and roll the dough out into a roughly 13" circle using a rolling pin.
11. Spread olive oil into a 12" cast iron pan, add the rolled-out dough, and spread it evenly across the bottom and sides of the pan making sure the crust comes all the way up the sides.
12. Add fat-free cheese, then a layer of whole milk cheese, and top with pepperoni. Add sauce to the top layer of the pizza, making sure everything is evenly spread out.
13. Bake pizza in a preheated 400°F oven for 30-40 minutes. Once removed from the oven, top with parmesan, slice it, and it is time to eat.

## Tips

I would wait 5-10 minutes before slicing and another 5 minutes before serving to avoid burning your mouth. You have been warned.
