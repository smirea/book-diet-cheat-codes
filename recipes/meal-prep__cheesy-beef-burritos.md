## Ingredients

### BEEF MIX

- 896g 96% lean ground beef
- 15g all-purpose flour
- 3g chili powder
- 2g crushed red pepper
- 4g ground cumin
- 2g garlic powder
- 2g onion powder
- 1g dried oregano
- 4g paprika
- 9g salt
- 4g MSG
- 3g black pepper
- 480g beef bone broth
- 7g gelatin
- 102g tomato paste
- 500g fat-free Greek yogurt

### ASSEMBLY

- La Bandertita® Carb Counter soft taco tortilla
- La Bandertita® Carb Counter street taco tortilla
- 30g jalapeño cheddar dip
- 30g fat-free refried black beans
- 86g beef mix
- 7g 2% sharp cheddar cheese, grated

## Directions

1. Mix flour, chili powder, red pepper, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, paprika, salt, MSG, and black pepper in a small bowl. (Omit chili powder and red pepper if heat sensitive.)
2. Add ground beef to a preheated pan on medium heat and spread it evenly to fully cover the bottom.
3. Place a heavy object (like another pan) on top for even browning. Cook 8-12 minutes.
4. Sprinkle gelatin over broth and let absorb.
5. Crumble beef into small pieces, mix in seasoning, and cook for 30 seconds.
6. Stir in the bloomed broth-gelatin mixture and tomato paste. Bring to a simmer and reduce for 10-12 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes.
7. Remove from heat, let cool for 10 minutes, then stir in Greek yogurt until fully combined.
8. Lay out soft taco tortillas and spread 30g of cheddar dip in a circle about the size of the street taco tortillas.
9. Spread 30g of refried beans onto each street taco tortilla and place them on top of the cheddar dip layer.
10. Add 86g beef mix on top of the beans, followed by 7g sharp cheddar cheese.
11. Fold both ends of the tortilla inward, tucking them in farther than expected.
12. While holding the ends in place, fold the flap nearest to you over the filling, tucking in any escaping ingredients, then roll up tightly. Repeat until you have 20 burritos.
13. Store burritos: Refrigerate what you will eat in the next 2-4 days and freeze the rest.
14. When you need more, move 2-3 days' worth from the freezer to the fridge to thaw for 24 hours.
15. FROM FRIDGE: Microwave for 60-90 seconds wrapped in parchment.
16. FROM FREEZER: Bake for 30-35 minutes in a 460 degree oven wrapped in foil.
