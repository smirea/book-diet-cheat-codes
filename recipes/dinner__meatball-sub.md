## Directions

1. Add olive oil and onions to a preheated oven-safe pot on medium heat and stir to combine.
2. Press in garlic, stir to combine, and let mixture cook for 3-5 minutes.
3. Add tomato paste, combine the rest of the Sauce Ingredients thoroughly, and let combination simmer for 1 minute.
4. Put an immersion blender into the can of tomatoes, blend 15-20 seconds or until smooth, add to the pan with the rest of the Sauce ingredients, and stir to combine. You can also crush the tomatoes by hand if you prefer.
5. Once sauce starts bubbling, give it a stir, turn stovetop to low, and let sauce simmer for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. Into a large bowl add milk, bread, and an egg and whisk until mixture looks like a wet banana pudding.
7. Add the remaining meatball ingredients into the bowl and mix until well combined.
8. Divide meatball mixture into 120g portions, form into balls, and spread out evenly on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.
9. Bake meatballs in a preheated 475°F oven for 15 minutes, flip the meatballs, and continue cooking for another 5-8 minutes.
10. Turn oven down to 350°F, add meatballs to the sauce, and mix them until completely covered.
11. Throw pot into the oven, without a lid, along with frozen protein baguettes for 15 minutes.
12. Cut the baguette in half lengthwise and put a layer of sauce on the bottom piece of the baguette. Add meatballs, another layer of sauce on top of the meatballs, optional parmesan, and close the sandwich with the top of the baguette.

## Tips

You can use store bought baguettes if you would like, but the protein baguette recipe makes 8 servings that you can store in the freezer for months and is well worth making in my opinion.
