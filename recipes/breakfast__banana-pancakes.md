## Ingredients

### WET

- 120g banana
- 100g egg whites
- 4.2g vanilla extract
- 25g granulated erythritol

### DRY

- 20g all-purpose flour
- 30g PEScience Gourmet Vanilla protein powder
- 1g salt
- 1.5g baking powder

## Directions

1. Mash the banana with a fork or hand mixer, add the rest of your Wet Ingredients, and stir to combine.
2. In a separate bowl, combine the Dry Ingredients and mix together.
3. Pour your dry ingredients into your wet ingredients and whisk until just combined.
4. Lightly coat a pan with oil and preheat on medium. When the pan is preheated, add enough batter to the pan to form pancakes in your desired size.
5. After 2-3 minutes or when the bottom of the pancakes are browned, lightly spray the top of the pancakes with oil to prevent any sticking, then flip, and cook the topside.
6. Once cooked to your liking, remove the pancakes from pan, and optionally garnish with a few slices of bananas.
7. Time to eat.

## Tips

If bulking or for greater flavor, substitute two whole eggs for the egg whites.
