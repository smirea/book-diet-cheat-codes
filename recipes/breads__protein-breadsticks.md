## Ingredients

### DRY

- 131g King Arthur® all-purpose flour
- 34g vital wheat gluten
- 1.5g salt
- 3g instant yeast
- 6g granulated erythritol

### WET

- 5g avocado oil
- 115g water

### TOPPING

- 4g unsalted butter
- 5g grated parmesan
- Dash salt
- Dash garlic powder
- Dash dried parsley

## Directions

1. Add all Dry Ingredients into a food processor and process for 30 seconds.
2. Add avocado oil over the top of the Dry Ingredients.
3. Heat up water to 110°F.
4. While processing on high, slowly mix in water over 10-15 seconds and continue to process for an additional 30 seconds.
5. Plop dough onto the counter, roll it around for 1 minute, form it into a ball, place in a lightly oiled bowl, and cover for 30 minutes.
6. Divide dough into roughly six 48g portions, roll each piece out using your hands, pop any big air bubbles while doing so, and get them to about 8" in length.
7. Place each piece of dough on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper or a silicone liner, keeping the breadsticks evenly apart. Cover with another sheet pan or a damp towel for about 20 minutes.
8. Put breadsticks into a preheated 400°F oven for 12-15 minutes or until bottom of breadsticks are nicely browned.
9. Add butter, salt, and garlic powder in a small bowl, then microwave until the butter is melted. Mix ingredients to combine.
10. Brush each bread stick with the butter mixture and top with parmesan and parsley while breadsticks are hot.
11. Eat one or all 6. Both are great options.
