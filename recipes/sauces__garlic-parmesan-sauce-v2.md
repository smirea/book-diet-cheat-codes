## Directions

1. ROAST 2-3 HEADS OF GARLIC.
2. Add all ingredients into a high-sided container besides avocado oil, xanthan gum, and parsley.
3. Using an immersion blender, mix to combine.
4. Add avocado oil and xanthan gum to a small bowl. Mix until the xanthan gum has completely dissolved into the oil.

## Notes

This sauce should stay good at least two weeks, especially if you make it with fresh greek yogurt. If you are worried about having too much sauce, I would suggest making a half batch first.
