## Ingredients

### DRY

- 195g all-purpose flour
- 78g vital wheat gluten
- 3.6g salt
- 4.5g baking powder

### WET

- 365g 2% Greek yogurt

### SHAPING

- 18g flour (for rolling)

## Directions

1. Add dry ingredients to a bowl and whisk to combine.
2. Place yogurt in the bowl and mix with a spoon until a shaggy dough forms.
3. Using your hand, press and fold the dough until fully combined and no dry ingredients remain.
4. Split the dough into 6 equal pieces (about 107g each) and shape into balls.
5. Place a dough ball on the counter, flatten with your palm, then lightly dust the top and bottom with flour.
6. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough 2-3 times, turn 90°, roll 2-3 more times, and repeat until the dough is about 7-8" wide and 1/8-1/4" thick. Whenever the dough starts to stick to the rolling pin, lightly dust both sides of the pita with flour, spread evenly, and continue rolling.
7. Place the pita in a preheated pan over medium heat and cook each side for 1-2 minutes, or until browned to your preference.
8. While each pita cooks, roll out the next dough ball.
9. Move the cooked pita to a tea towel and fold the towel over it to prevent it from drying out. Repeat the cooking process with remaining dough.

## Tips

Freeze any pitas you won't eat within 2-3 days. Microwave on a plate covered with a damp paper towel for 30-60 seconds, or until soft and heated through.
